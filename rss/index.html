Sorta, here‚Äôs mine."><p>For the last few months I‚Äôve been working on a new YouTube channel called <a href="https://jonathanleemartin.com/tldr/">TL;DR: a JavaScript screencast series</a> for working web developers. Since starting my <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/im-going-on-a-travel-sabbatical-and-you-can-too/">travel sabbatical</a> back in November of 2018, I‚Äôve been building my own <a href="https://jonathanleemartin.com/">training brand</a> and assets in hopes that I can strike a healthier balance between teaching, travel and photography.</p>
<p>This is my second time launching a YouTube channel. My first one ‚Äî <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Yellowscale">Yellowscale</a> ‚Äî is mostly recorded on the road in hotel rooms and the fells of the Lake District. That worked great for my target audience, and I hit 1000 subscribers in about 7 months.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oAEfKLI8iKk" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen width="16" height="9"></iframe>
<p>But TL;DR needs to reflect my teaching style in a classroom or workshop, so this time I felt it was important to improve the production value.</p>
<p>Just one problem: <em>I‚Äôm still a <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/your-map-to-mount-nomad/">digital nomad</a>.</em> Even after <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/after-4-months-on-the-road-whats-next/">returning to the US</a>, I‚Äôve moved on average every 2 months. And I‚Äôm still planning to hit the road again.</p>
<p>Is it possible to have a nice, compact recording studio that‚Äôs easy to pack up every couple months, and flexible to most spaces ‚Äî without spending a fortune?</p>
<p>Well, sorta. It won‚Äôt fit in my <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/ultralight-digital-nomad-packing-list/">carry-on backpack</a>, but it‚Äôll move from place-to-place when I‚Äôm back in the states. Here‚Äôs an overview of my (mostly) nomadic-friendly setup, with links to the things!</p>
<h2 id="studioequipment">Studio Equipment</h2>
<h3 id="4xledlightpanels">4x LED Light Panels</h3>
<p>4x <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XW3B81V/?tag=nybblr08-20">Neewer 660 LED Panels</a>. I am seriously in love with these: they are stupid bright, came with decent barndoors, wall plugs and light stands, put out a high CRI light, and run cool. Since I‚Äôm recording in small spaces and have to kill AC, it‚Äôs hard to overstate how important that is!</p>
<p>I use 3 of the panels for subject lighting (me!): key light, fill light and rim light. I use the 4th panel with a gel to color the backdrop depending on the look I want. On TL;DR I don‚Äôt use the 4th light, but I probably will for new Yellowscale vlogs.</p>
<h3 id="smartphoneteleprompter">Smartphone Teleprompter</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MS0E9WE/?tag=nybblr08-20">Parrot Teleprompter 2 For Smartphone</a>. You may be fine without a teleprompter, but to record my TL;DR episodes with any hope of getting them near 5 minutes, I absolutely have to script it. And there‚Äôs nothing more awkward than staring off into space rather than your audience. This slides right over any lens ‚Äî slap an old smartphone in, and boom! You‚Äôve got (mostly) flawless takes on the first take.</p>
<h3 id="1xsoftbox">1x Softbox</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076W62DGM/?tag=nybblr08-20">Neewer Collapsible Softbox Diffuser</a>. The LED light panels produce a decently soft light, but the key light wasn‚Äôt soft enough. This little diffuser does a great job, especially in tight spaces where a traditional softbox or umbrella would take way too much space!</p>
<h3 id="lightingaccessories">Lighting Accessories</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CCIKB5Q/?tag=nybblr08-20">Neewer 12x12 Pack of 8 Colored Gels</a>. Since LED panels run cool, nothing fancy required! Just attach them to the barndoors with a binder clip.</p>
<p>2x <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B018LQGL8O/?tag=nybblr08-20">Neewer 10‚Äù Gooseneck Tube Arm</a>. To get my key light as close as possible, I needed these to ‚Äúcrane‚Äù the lightbox above me. Super sturdy since the LED panels are so light.</p>
<h3 id="blueyetiusbmic">Blue Yeti USB Mic</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Blackout/dp/B00N1YPXW2/?tag=nybblr08-20">Blue Yeti USB Microphone, Black</a>. I‚Äôve been recording with a Yeti for a year now, and love it.</p>
<h3 id="audioaccessories">Audio Accessories</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073Z9NF3Y/?tag=nybblr08-20">Auphonix Shock Mount</a>. A must if you‚Äôre planning to type on the same surface the mic is mounted to!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01L3LL95O/?tag=nybblr08-20">InnoGear Boom Arm Stand</a>. Get‚Äôs the mic out of your way and closer to you, plus it kills some vibrations!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GK6JUOE/?tag=nybblr08-20">Sure-Max 12 Heavy-Duty Moving Blankets</a>. My ‚Äúacoustic treatment‚Äù pi√®ce de r√©sistance for killing room reverb. These aren‚Äôt good for a monitoring setup, but they do a great job for recording! My room was an echo chamber before treatment. Easy to hang with some binder clips and wire hanger nails.</li>
<li>Pop Filter. Literally any will do.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="yesnomadscanhaveastudio">Yes, nomads can have a studio!</h2>
<p>That‚Äôs it! It‚Äôs not part of my <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/ultralight-digital-nomad-packing-list/">ultralight digital nomad packing list</a>, but it‚Äôs compact and flexible enough not to hold me back from new adventures.</p>

<p>What‚Äôs the easiest way to travel? With one carry-on sized backpack. It sounds crazy, but every digital nomad packing list I see tends to converge to this utopia, and it‚Äôs not surprising why.</p>
<p><strong>No checked bags means:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>No wait to check bags or surprise fees</li>
<li>No lost baggage</li>
<li>You can use budget airlines</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Traveling with one carry-on bag means:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Much less stress during transit and fewer missed layovers</li>
<li>No repacking between hotels and fewer misplaced items</li>
<li>Less stress if your rental car gets smashed</li>
</ol>
<p>In a word, traveling light with one carry-on sized bag is <em>freedom</em>.</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/the-digital-nomad-lifestyle-is-more-about-freedom-and-less-about-travel/">digital nomad</a>, honing your one bag packing list will help turn your dream of traveling around the world indefinitely into reality, and <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/your-map-to-mount-nomad/">now is the time for you to practice</a>.</p>
<p>I didn‚Äôt instantly cut down my existence to one bag: <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/im-going-on-a-travel-sabbatical-and-you-can-too/">I‚Äôve spent years</a> learning what I can and can‚Äôt get away with. To expedite your journey, <strong>here‚Äôs my entire minimalist packing list for a &lt;10kg pack.</strong> It‚Äôs long, so here‚Äôs a table if you want to skip around.</p>
<h2 id="recentupdates">Recent Updates</h2>

<p><img src="https://www.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/03/one-bag-packing-list.jpg" alt="Ultralight Packing List for Digital Nomads & Photographers: 1 Carry-On Bag, Indefinite Travel."></p>
<h2 id="bags">Bags</h2>
<p>Lies. Actually, I‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ have‚Ä¶ recommendations yet! I‚Äôve traveled for a year with a Lowepro hiking bag ‚Äî it works, but I‚Äôve not been overly happy with it. So until I find the perfect bag, I‚Äôll hold off on a recommendation.</p>
<p>However, if you aren‚Äôt traveling with camera gear, <strong>go with a daypack</strong> instead of a full-blown backpack. I love my 17 liter North Face daypack (discontinued,¬†<a href="https://www.amazon.com/North-Face-Jester-Backpack-Black/dp/B00OS67V6S/?tag=nybblr08-20">here‚Äôs a larger one</a> if you‚Äôre less lucky at T.J.Maxx), but there‚Äôs not anything particularly special about it other than the size. Thanks to a strict packing regime, it holds everything I need for indefinite travel‚Ä¶ without camera gear.</p>
<p>Also, don‚Äôt forget to pack a <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Outdoor-Products-Packable-Daypack-Black/19487073">foldable nylon daypack</a>. <em>Bag inception.</em> It takes almost no space, and after your flight you can shove clothes and toiletries in it so your main bag sheds some weight.</p>
<h2 id="clothes">Clothes</h2>
<p>I‚Äôve spent a few years honing my ultralight wardrobe, and a few characteristics apply to everything. First, <strong>eliminate any clothing that is 100% cotton.</strong> This is a non-negotiable: you won‚Äôt exactly wash your clothes everyday, and cotton will be unpleasant during use, smell awful after use, and turn to rock once you get around to washing it. Why pack 10 cotton tees that fit so-so and are miserable in hot weather, instead of owning 3 shirts that look great and are made of materials that perform well in inclement weather?</p>
<p>Your wardrobe should be primarily made of nature‚Äôs miracle fabric, <strong>merino wool.</strong> It resists odors, keeps you cool in the heat and warm in the cold, and air dries without turning to rock. Even when I‚Äôm not traveling, merino wool is pretty much the only fabric I own. Yes, it‚Äôs pricey ‚Äî but you only need 2‚Äì3 of most items, and you won‚Äôt purchase them often. It‚Äôs a small price to pay for legendary comfort and not smelling like a vagabond.</p>
<p><strong>I follow the three-layer system:</strong> a merino wool base layer, a down jacket for the mid layer and a rain jacket for the outer layer. Whether I‚Äôm headed for 80 degrees or 20 degrees, I‚Äôm covered!</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs the entire clothing list:</p>
<h3 id="shirts">Shirts</h3>
<p><strong>3 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Icebreaker-Everyday-Short-Sleeve-Crewe/dp/B00AF6ZV4O/?tag=nybblr08-20">Icebreaker merino wool shirts</a></strong> for the base layer: a short sleeve and long sleeve will cover a wide range of temperatures. Merino wool comes in <a href="https://www.onebagger.com/merino-wool-guide/">a lot of grades</a> and weights, so it‚Äôs not a place to skimp. Short sleeves are generally thin and come in a weight of 150 g/m2 (grams per square meter), while long sleeves are a thicker 200 g/m2. I travel with 3 variations:</p>
<ol>
<li>A dressy black <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Icebreaker-Merino-Anatomica-Sleeve-Monsoon/dp/B01GXGN6HI/?tag=nybblr08-20">Icebreaker Anatomica V-neck</a>, with a fabric weight of 150 g/m2. It‚Äôs well fitted, so it looks great solo or layered under anything. Lately these are getting hard to find at less than retail price, so you might have to do some googling if you can‚Äôt find a color and size you like. If V-necks aren‚Äôt your thing, I own a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072KVDXMW/?tag=nybblr08-20">crew version as well</a> that served me well.</li>
<li>A thicker <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AF5ISPO/?tag=nybblr08-20">Icebreaker Oasis Crewe</a>, which comes in 200 g/m2. It seems discontinued, but there‚Äôs a newer lookalike with the same specs, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Icebreaker-Everyday-Short-Sleeve-Crewe/dp/B00AF6ZV4O/?tag=nybblr08-20">Icebreaker Everyday Crewe</a>. The crew is slightly less fitted than the Anatomica lineup, but look greats and has seen the most use ‚Äî even in warmer climates.</li>
<li>A long sleeve <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Icebreaker-Merino-Everyday-Sleeve-Crewe/dp/B00AF6ZKL8/?tag=nybblr08-20">Icebreaker Everyday Long Sleeve Tee</a> in 200 g/m2. I use it in two extremes: when it‚Äôs below 30 degrees outside, or when it‚Äôs hot and sunny. It sounds counterintuitive, but the long sleeves keep the heat off you while wicking away sweat, so it‚Äôs often more comfortable than a short sleeve and wearing sunscreen.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="downjacket">Down Jacket</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Patagonia-Mens-Down-Sweater-Hoodie/dp/B073RP8KSK/?tag=nybblr08-20">Patagonia down jacket</a></strong>. You can‚Äôt beat a down jacket for weight to warmth ratio, but like merino wool, a down jacket isn‚Äôt just for the frozen fjords: it acts as an insulator in moderate temperatures. I frequently wear a merino base layer and down jacket in 50 degree weather and don‚Äôt notice the warmth.</p>
<p>Down jackets don‚Äôt have to break the bank: before upgrading to my Patagonia down jacket, I used a $50 REI Coop jacket that still does a great job. In fact, it fits more easily in my camera bag.</p>
<h3 id="rainjacket">Rain Jacket</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Outdoor-Research-Helium-Jacket-Black/dp/B00ELMXNG6/?tag=nybblr08-20">Outdoor Research Helium HD rain jacket</a></strong>. The outer layer doesn‚Äôt see constant use like the base and mid layers, but it‚Äôs indispensable for any traveler. A DWR-treated down jacket is not enough: the third layer is meant to provide <em>real</em> wind and water protection. You should always have a rain jacket handy, so I opted for the best ultralight option I could find. Fair disclosure: because I use rain jackets infrequently, I haven‚Äôt put my HD under too much stress, but so far it‚Äôs been a huge upgrade from my clammy North Face Venture jacket.</p>
<p>If you are willing to forego a few features, go for ‚Äúthe‚Äù ultralight champion: the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Outdoor-Research-Helium-Jacket-Pewter/dp/B07KNWJH25/?tag=nybblr08-20">Outdoor Research Helium II rain jacket</a>. This is the #1 recommendation in ultralight jackets, and it‚Äôs cheaper than the HD! I went with the HD for one reason: I need pockets. Otherwise, the Helium II would have been my clear choice.</p>
<h3 id="socks">Socks</h3>
<p><strong>2‚Äì3 pairs of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Darn-Tough-Vermont-Cushion-X-Large/dp/B008RSF3OU/?tag=nybblr08-20">Darn Tough merino wool socks</a></strong>. There‚Äôs nothing worse than rotten smelling socks after a day of hiking. These socks are worth every dollar ‚Äî they keep the feet comfortable in all climates, have lots of cushion, resist odor, and are pretty easy to hand-wash. I‚Äôve worn the same 2 pairs every day for 3 years.</p>
<p>I have 2 pairs of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Darn-Tough-Vermont-Cushion-X-Large/dp/B008RSF3OU/?tag=nybblr08-20">Darn Tough‚Äôs 1/4 style</a>, which are my favorite to wear, and for shorts weather I have 2 pairs of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Darn-Tough-No-Show-Cushion-Athletic/dp/B00F0NCJNS/?tag=nybblr08-20">Darn Tough No Shows</a>. Supposedly Darn Tough will replace the sock if it gets a hole, but I haven‚Äôt yet needed to take advantage of that.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I love Darn Tough‚Äôs 1/4 style socks, but haven‚Äôt been 100% sold on their no shows, which actually show. After a month of non-stop wear, I can highly recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FITS-Light-Runner-Show-Black/dp/B0748ZV3R2?tag=nybblr08-20">FITS Light Runner No Show</a> merino wool socks.</p>
<h3 id="leggings">Leggings</h3>
<p><strong>1 pair of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AFOPNBC/?tag=nybblr08-20">Icebreaker Oasis merino wool leggings</a></strong> to go under your jeans in sub 30 degree weather. With some luck, sometimes you can snag a pair out of season for $20 at a T.J.Maxx.</p>
<h3 id="jeans">Jeans</h3>
<p><strong>1 pair of <a href="https://shop.outlier.nyc/shop/retail/slim-dungarees.html">Outlier Slim Dungarees</a>.</strong> I‚Äôve done a lot of research searching for the perfect pants, and though the Dungarees are my overall recommendation, here are 4 excellent options to accomodate any budget:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Best looking, priciest option:</strong> <a href="https://shop.outlier.nyc/shop/retail/slim-dungarees.html">Outlier Slim Dungarees</a>. Great for colder climates, I‚Äôm pretty sure these will last longer than anything else I wear. The fit has been tricky: I‚Äôve exchanged sizes twice, as despite being slim, the waist measurement is different from most of the pants I‚Äôve purchased. The legs are intentionally long, so plan to get them hemmed. Oh, these have a liquid-repellant treatment ‚Äî good thing, I spilled some coffee on them the other day.</li>
<li><strong>Feel great, mid-price option:</strong> <a href="https://shop.bluffworks.com/products/chino-tailored-fit-travel-pants-charcoal?rfsn=2081176.4a2824">Bluffworks Tailored Chinos</a>. I have to say, I love these: they were a bit resistant to squats at first, but with a little working in these feel amazing and had the best fit of any pants I‚Äôve ever worn, period. Super lightweight. I‚Äôm inclined to grab these for warmer (40‚Ñâ+) climates: they breathe well, and I didn‚Äôt sweat once while city exploring. However, in chillier climates these feel a bit too thin ‚Äî definitely pair with <a href="#leggings">merino wool leggings</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Stretchy budget option:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/prAna-30-Inch-Inseam-Charcoal-inseam/dp/B006QM6XM0/?tag=nybblr08-20">prAna Brion pants</a>. These DWR-treated pants feel amazing for hiking. Unlike the Outlier and Bluffworks, these have some vertical stretch that‚Äôs especially useful for intense hikes, or squatting for a shot. These look great: I wouldn‚Äôt have qualms about wearing them to a training engagement. Waist fit is great, but legs are a little long. Don‚Äôt expect these to last long: after some in-depth searching, it sounds like they aren‚Äôt especially known for durability.</li>
<li><strong>Any jeans with &gt; 20% polyester</strong>. Polyester mix jeans are incredibly durable, insanely light, comfortable and surprisingly stylish even on business trips. They hold their shape well and dry out quickly. Keep an eye on your local department stores and you may find a pair of $20 with patience. Whatever you do, don‚Äôt travel with cotton jeans ‚Äî your everything thanks you.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="shorts">Shorts</h3>
<p><strong>1 pair of <a href="https://shop.outlier.nyc/shop/retail/new-way-longs.html">Outlier New Way Longs</a>.</strong> I can‚Äôt tell you how many years I‚Äôve searched for good shorts. Amazing travel shorts have to be nothing short of miraculous to meet all these constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look nice enough you‚Äôd wear them to work.</li>
<li>Fit on the slim side without restraining motion.</li>
<li>Ultralight, wrinkle-free material.</li>
<li>Stretch for hiking and cycling.</li>
<li>No frills or cargo pockets that scream ‚Äútourist!‚Äù</li>
<li>Fast drying technical fabric that resists the ocassional splash.</li>
<li>Don‚Äôt look or feel like gym shorts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, the same folks who make <a href="#jeans">my favorite travel pants</a> have released shorts that are quietly rocking my world. The <a href="https://shop.outlier.nyc/shop/retail/new-way-longs.html">Outlier New Way Longs</a> have a fantastic fit that looks great in the office and on the trail.</p>
<p>The super lightweight, thin technical fabric feels surprisingly durable, so it‚Äôs hard to go wrong. I wear these every day in town, on the trail, and for an hour bike commute every day. These are the real deal. That sounds like a sales pitch, but seriously I‚Äôve gone years without shorts. Oh, these also have drawstrings so you can take them for a swim!</p>
<p>As with Outlier‚Äôs pants, the sizes run a size or two large ‚Äî or perhaps I‚Äôm just losing weight from all the walking and cycling!</p>
<h3 id="underwear">Underwear</h3>
<p><strong>3 pairs of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ExOfficio-Give-N-Go-Boxer-Brief-Medium/dp/B001M0MMZS/?tag=nybblr08-20">ExOfficio Boxer Briefs</a></strong>. Yep, time for fancy underwear. Anything that isn‚Äôt 100% cotton will do, but polyester is the way to go since you have to sink wash them every (other?) day anyway. My pairs pilled a bit when I first got them, but haven‚Äôt gotten any worse after 2 years of constant use.</p>
<p>A word of warning: lately ExOfficio seems to be having quality assurance issues. My brother just got the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ExOfficio-Give-N-Go-Sport-Medium-Phantom/dp/B00MOBSSUC/?tag=nybblr08-20">ExOfficio Sport Boxer Briefs</a> and it started sticking to itself and pilling like crazy after one sink-wash ‚Äî disappointing to say the least. The original ExOfficio Boxer Briefs aren‚Äôt as comfortable for hiking, so the Sport was on my upgrade list, but I think I‚Äôll wait till quality control gets their act together.</p>
<h3 id="shoes">Shoes</h3>
<p><strong>1 pair of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Merrell-Mens-Moab-Hiking-Earth/dp/B01HFACAZU/?tag=nybblr08-20">waterproof Merrell Gore-Tex hiking shoes</a></strong>. I‚Äôm not sold on the look, but hiking shoes are definitely my go-to travel shoes for city trekking and hiking in the Lake District fells.</p>
<h3 id="wallet">Wallet</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Infinity-Wallet-Mens-Minimalist-Blue/dp/B00W8TU86W/?tag=nybblr08-20">Infinity Minimalist Wallet</a></strong>. I only carry 4 cards, and for security I keep my wallet in my front pocket. This teeny tiny wallet keeps my slim travel pants slim, but has an expanding slot for the ocassional krona.</p>
<h2 id="tech">Tech</h2>
<h3 id="smartphone">Smartphone</h3>
<p><strong>Any smartphone</strong> except an iPhone Plus or Samsung Galaxy. A giant phone screen will be your enemy as a nomad: many of the travel jeans don‚Äôt have a large enough pocket, and given the amount of walking and hiking you‚Äôll be doing, a large screen will either get bent or smashed.</p>
<h3 id="laptop">Laptop</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MNYF2LL-MacBook-Processor-Version/dp/B072QGG3V7/?tag=nybblr08-20">12‚Äù MacBook</a></strong> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Retina-MPXV2LL-Version/dp/B071WLXKB3/?tag=nybblr08-20">13‚Äù MacBook Pro</a>. Lugging around a 15‚Äù brick is out of the question. I‚Äôve switched between the 13‚Äù and 12‚Äù over the last few years, and I‚Äôm torn: the 12‚Äù is the last word on portability and plenty powerful for everything <em>except</em> editing photos. If I can find a backpack I like and cut down the weight of my camera gear, I‚Äôll probably go back to the 13-incher. C‚Äômon Apple, work your magic!</p>
<h3 id="laptopcharger">Laptop Charger</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Innergie-Adapter-US-PowerDelivery-Technology-USB-World-Small/dp/B07GBYVF4Q/?tag=nybblr08-20">Innergie 60C USB-C Charger</a></strong>. The bulkiest, heaviest part of my pack has always been my MacBook charger. Over the past year, I‚Äôve spent days researching chargers and tried a few <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/after-4-months-on-the-road-whats-next/">during 4 months on the road</a>. After the horror of having three chargers fail on me overseas, I finally found one that gives me faith in electronics again.</p>
<p>This is one of the smallest, lightest 60 watt chargers our there, and is a true replacement for Apple‚Äôs 61 watt chargers. Because it‚Äôs USB-C, it has also replaced my USB wall chargers for my iPhone, headlamp, and action camera. Pro-tip: grab the teeny tiny <a href="https://www.amazon.com/nonda-Adapter-Aluminum-Indicator-Macbook/dp/B015Z7XE0A/?tag=nybblr08-20">nonda USB-C to USB 3.0</a> adapter to charge any USB device.</p>
<p>Yes, this is an expensive charger ‚Äî probably the most I‚Äôve ever paid for a charger, period. But if I‚Äôve learned anything after 4 months overseas, it‚Äôs that nothing will cripple you faster or give you more anxiety than a flakey laptop charger. I lost days of shoot time and spent hundreds of dollars replacing chargers with whatever I could find in an electronics store, and in Iceland or the Lake District, your options aren‚Äôt overwhelming.</p>
<h3 id="headlamp">Headlamp</h3>
<p><strong>Hiking headlamp like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-Diamond-Spot-Headlamp-Size/dp/B06W54SBSL/?tag=nybblr08-20">Black Diamond Spot</a></strong>. I prefer a USB rechargeable one so I don‚Äôt need to carry backup batteries (more weight and space), but haven‚Äôt yet tested out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-Diamond-Revolt-Headlamp-Denim/dp/B01LE9Z6PO/?tag=nybblr08-20">Black Diamond ReVolt</a>.</p>
<h3 id="adapters">Adapters</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Type-C-HDMI-Multiport-Adapter/dp/B01LYJQ5ZD/?tag=nybblr08-20">Amazon Basics USB-C adapter</a></strong>. Yeah, you can pay 50% more for Apple‚Äôs, but from the reviews it seems notoriously glitchy. On the off-chance my Amazon Basics version goes bad, I also tote the teeny tiny <a href="https://www.amazon.com/nonda-Adapter-Aluminum-Indicator-Macbook/dp/B015Z7XE0A/?tag=nybblr08-20">nonda USB-C to USB 3.0</a> adapter.</p>
<h3 id="plugadapters">Plug Adapters</h3>
<p><strong>2 OREI plug adapters</strong> for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DTRHB2G/?tag=nybblr08-20">mainland Europe</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/OREI-Grounded-Universal-Adapter-Singapore/dp/B004SCSV2U/?tag=nybblr08-20">the UK</a>. Keep in mind that these plugs do <strong>not</strong> convert the voltage, so check all your electronics to make sure they can operate on the country‚Äôs power grid. Most smartphones, laptops and camera gear work with 240V out of the box, but always double check lest you fry your gear and hotel room.</p>
<p>As I expand my list of countries I may consider a universal plug adapter, but the dedicated plugs are so cheap, light, compact and expendable that I don‚Äôt see any reason to purchase a bulky universal adapter.</p>
<h3 id="earbuds">Earbuds</h3>
<p><strong>OEM Apple earbuds</strong>. Hard to lose, cheap to replace, but useless on flights. Bulky headphones are out of the question, but I‚Äôm eyeing these noise-blocking earbuds: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00D429Y12/?tag=nybblr08-20">Bose QuietComfort 20i</a>. I‚Äôm not ready to drop a few hundred bucks on earbuds, but if I decide to care about audio and noise cancellation, these will be first on my wishlist.</p>
<h3 id="backupdrive">Backup Drive</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Portable-External-Photography-STDR2000100/dp/B00FRHTTIU/?tag=nybblr08-20">Seagate 2TB Slim External Hard Drive</a></strong>. I back up my photos daily for a total of three copies: originals on my CompactFlash cards, imported DNGs on my laptop, and DNG copies on my the backup drive.</p>
<p>In case my backpack is stolen, I keep backup devices in at least two locations. In transit, I keep CF cards in my pocket and the backup drive in my backpack. Since rear-end collisions are common, I recommend storing your gear in the rear passenger seat instead of the trunk.</p>
<h3 id="carcharger">Car Charger</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-PowerDrive-iPhone-Galaxy/dp/B00VH84L5E/?tag=nybblr08-20">Anker Dual USB car charger</a></strong>. As a digital nomad, it seems impossible to live without a smartphone ‚Äî maps, bookings, offline translations ‚Äî so a dead phone triggers my panic button. <strong>Never cheap out on chargers:</strong> a poor converter will damage your pricey equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I‚Äôm testing out a (much) smaller dual charger with great reviews: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charger-RAVPower-Adapter-iSmart-Compatible/dp/B071FHZRQN/?tag=nybblr08-20">RAVPower 24W 4.8A Dual USB Car Adapter</a>.

<h3 id="memorycards">Memory Cards</h3>

Your memory cards need to be rock-solid reliable after thousands of miles traveled and dollars spent. And with <a href="https://www.magiclantern.fm/">Magic Lantern</a>, these cards are fast enough to <a href="https://vimeo.com/139290481">shoot gorgeous RAW footage</a>. Still, I‚Äôm looking forward to a mirrorless camera so I can just use cheaper SD cards.</p>
<h3 id="cardreader">Card Reader</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-Professional-USB-Dual-Slot-Reader/dp/B00WBK03OU/?tag=nybblr08-20">Lexar CompactFlash card reader</a></strong>. Cheap readers can corrupt CF cards, so it‚Äôs worth spending a few extra dollars for a reputable one.</p>
<h3 id="camerabattery">Camera Battery</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-9486B002-Battery-Pack-LP-E6N/dp/B00NI3CSIS/?tag=nybblr08-20">1 extra battery</a></strong>. The 5D‚Äôs impressive battery life usually lasts a couple days, but more than once I‚Äôve forgotten to charge it.</p>
<h3 id="cplfilter">CPL Filter</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kaesemann-Circular-Polarizer-Multi-Resistant-Coating/dp/B00OK6YSAS/?tag=nybblr08-20">B+W CPL filter</a></strong>. I have the previous generation, but B+W recently released an upgraded polarizer that cuts out less light and is cheaper.</p>

I‚Äôve been through three tripods, and this one strikes the perfect balance between stability and ultralight portability. And the twist locks are fantastic!</p>
<h3 id="ballhead">Ball Head</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Really-Right-Stuff-BH30LR-BH-30/dp/B06XB6F429/?tag=nybblr08-20">Really Right Stuff BH-30 Ball Head</a>.</strong> This is my favorite gear upgrade of the last year: it‚Äôs an Arca-style, rock solid, lightweight ball head that is a delight to use and trivial to pack. Many photographers prefer the clamp version, but I love the knob version: it‚Äôs easy to twist even with gloves on, it shaves another ounce off the weight and is unbelievably compact.</p>
<h3 id="camerastraps">Camera Straps</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.peakdesign.com/products/leash?rfsn=2127959.733f41">Peak Design Leash camera straps</a></strong>. After hating on some cheap shoulder straps, I‚Äôm in love with Peak Design‚Äôs straps. The ultralight Leash straps strike the perfect balance for comfort, style, and nomad friendliness.</p>
<h3 id="microfibercloths">Microfiber Cloths</h3>
<p><strong>Two microfiber cloths</strong>. Just steal them from an Apple fanboy.</p>
<h3 id="gloves">Gloves</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://photographygloves.com/products/vallerret-photography-glove-markhof-pro-2-0?rfsn=2075447.40284a">Vallerret fingerless merino wool gloves</a></strong>. Fingers are the first thing to freeze in landscape photography, so I consider these part of my photography kit.</p>
<h2 id="toiletries">Toiletries</h2>
<p>The trick to ultralight packing isn‚Äôt to make everything smaller, but to figure out what you don‚Äôt need to bring in the first place! So nowadays <strong>I travel with almost no toiletries</strong> ‚Äî I only carry what I couldn‚Äôt live without. Maybe it sounds anti-climatic, but disposable goods are the easiest to pick up and the most irritating to transport.</p>
<p>No special brands here, it‚Äôs all disposable anyway. At all costs, avoid lots of little plastic bottles ‚Äî if it can go in a plastic bag, do it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Degree-Deodorant-Ounce-Ultra-Clear/dp/B01ENWLBXU/?tag=nybblr08-20">1 regular (full size) deodorant</a></strong>. Don‚Äôt bother with a travel-size deodorant. Go with an antiperspirant if you can: it‚Äôs lighter and will last for a few days. Look for one that specifically advertises it won‚Äôt leave stains ‚Äî it will eventually, but the buildup will take a week instead of hours and save your merino wool shirts from unnecessary washes.</li>
<li>1 regular toothbrush. Nope, it‚Äôs not even the cute fold-up one from Walmart‚Äôs travel section.</li>
<li>2 itty bitty toothpaste tubes. Why can‚Äôt they make a toothpaste tube that‚Äôs 3 oz?</li>
<li>TSA-friendly sick kit: some plastic bags with ibuprofen, loratadine and occasionally a <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Rice-Sock">homemade rice bag</a> cover a host of minor ailments.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do have one trick for the guys who want to maintain their hairstyle. Opt for a really thick hair wax or cement instead of gel, and the TSA won‚Äôt count it against your quota of liquids. For the last couple years, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Layrite-CEMENT042501-Cement-Clay/dp/B01LXGGO5E/?tag=nybblr08-20">Layrite Cement Hair Clay</a> has been my favorite. Not only does it take precious little wax to style, but you can scoop a palmful into a few makeup jars and be set for months at a time.</p>
<h2 id="whewthatseverything">Whew, that‚Äôs everything!</h2>
<p>Hopefully you learned a few tricks for your own ultralight packing list. Obviously this packing list is tailored specifically to my needs as a male digital nomad and landscape photographer.</p>
<p>With all this geekery comes an exhortation: never let unknowns ‚Äî least of all, ideal packing ‚Äî stop you from traveling. Don‚Äôt wait until you have the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù packing setup before seeing the world, because <strong>you will never reach perfection.</strong> However, you will approach perfection much faster through practice and journaling what worked well and what didn‚Äôt.</p>
<p><strong>So pack your bag and go see the world!</strong></p>

The first time I worked with a lab, my batch of photos all came out too dark and yellow. Why? Because I was editing on a screen that was too cool and bright.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs a pretty common result of going to print with an uncalibrated monitor.</p>
<p>By the next batch, I had borrowed a Spyder sensor from work and calibrated my monitor, tweaked the photos a bit, and sent them off to the lab. The photos still came out a bit dark and inky, but the color temperature was spot on.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.yellowscale.com/content/images/2019/08/185A1467.jpg" alt="Thoughts on Monitor Calibration (with DataColor‚Äôs SpyderX)"></p>
<p>Fast forward to my first metal print. I painstakingly tweaked a 10,800 by 7,200 pixel shot of Italy‚Äôs Sella Towers on my calibrated monitor to send to a prestigious lab in North Carolina. A few days later I received the proof: <em>not even close.</em> I followed up and described the issues. A week later I received the reproof: still off.</p>
<p>Four proofs later, I got the final 36 by 24 inch print. Stunning, and still a bit different from the screen version. When you are producing one-of-a-kind fine art prints, four proofs isn‚Äôt unusual. For commercial wedding work? You‚Äôd be exceptional to order a proof at all.</p>
<h2 id="calibratingwiththespyderxelite">Calibrating with the SpyderX Elite</h2>
<p>A few weeks ago, the awesome folks at DataColor reached out and asked if I‚Äôd like to take the new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Datacolor-Spyderx-Elite-Professional-Photographers/dp/B0076A620Y/?tag=nybblr08-20">SpyderX Elite</a> for a spin. It‚Äôs been a couple years since working with a lab, but now that I‚Äôm working from a newer MacBook, it seemed about time to recalibrate.</p>
<p>The calibration process was uneventful ‚Äî it took 10 minutes from opening the box till my screen was calibrated, and the actual calibration process took 60 seconds. Since the older Spyders, the software has gotten much less clunky and more Mac-ish. As before, my screen was calibrated a little warmer, pinker and less contrasty: Apple‚Äôs displays are well calibrated from the factory, but always tend to be overly blue and green and crush shadows.</p>
<p>And now that I‚Äôm calibrated, I have to be honest: <em>I‚Äôll probably never pull this sensor out again.</em> That is, not until I upgrade to a new laptop. The Spyder‚Äôs strength highlights just how niche monitor calibration tends to be, especially for digital freelancers like myself.</p>
<p>Would I have purchased the Spyder otherwise? <strong>Probably not,</strong> but not because the Spyder doesn‚Äôt do its job well: it does its job <em>too</em> well, and I‚Äôm simply not the target user.</p>
<p>I am a <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/the-digital-nomad-lifestyle-is-more-about-freedom-and-less-about-travel/">digital nomad</a> and <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/">fine art landscape photographer</a>. I <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/ultralight-digital-nomad-packing-list/">travel ultralight</a> and educate traveling photographers on how to <em>leave</em> gear behind. These photographers rarely work with a lab, and when they do it‚Äôs to produce fine art prints ‚Äî where no amount of monitor calibration will replace proofing, though it might help a bit with the first proof.</p>
<h2 id="downsidestomonitorcalibration">Downsides to Monitor Calibration</h2>
<p>Yes, really. Ironically, editing with a calibrated monitor has caused issues for my primary viewers: my <em>digital</em> audience. Most of my readers and watchers tend to own Macs and iOS devices, and Apple displays are pretty consistent with each other. Yes, they run cool and green, but <em>consistently</em> and not by much. So I actually <em>prefer</em> to edit with the built-in color profile active. Otherwise, photos edited with the calibrated profile always look dull to my iPhone and MacBook crowd.</p>
<h2 id="whoshouldcalibratetheirmonitor">Who Should Calibrate Their Monitor?</h2>
<p>So if ‚Äî as a photographer ‚Äî I‚Äôm not a good target user, who is? I‚Äôve found color calibration to be essential in a few scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>You frequently print for commercial clients.</li>
<li>Your digital audience has a large non-iOS/Mac crowd.</li>
<li>Your monitor is <em>substantially</em> off.</li>
<li>You have side-by-side external displays that need to match.</li>
<li>You need to sync color profiles across monitors in an office, such as a studio.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these describe you, I‚Äôll bet you already have a Spyder sensor at the office. If not, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Datacolor-Spyderx-Elite-Professional-Photographers/dp/B0076A620Y/?tag=nybblr08-20">you can grab one here</a>.</p>
<p>It turns out that, as a nomad, I am none of these. I primarily edit and deliver to digital, occasionally doing a metal print which, in the past, didn‚Äôt benefit from a calibrated monitor.</p>
<p>Color calibration is the sort of thing I expect teams to use for collaboration, but probably not freelancers. In contrast, when working with the video production team at church, I see a strong use case for calibrating all monitors and laptops.</p>
<h2 id="shouldyoubuyasensor">Should You Buy a Sensor?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Datacolor-Spyderx-Elite-Professional-Photographers/dp/B0076A620Y/?tag=nybblr08-20">SpyderX Elite</a> is a fantastic calibration sensor. The question is, do you need to calibrate your monitor at all? I will probably calibrate any laptop I own once or twice in its lifetime. Even then, I‚Äôll likely proof with the built-in profile for the sake of my substantially Apple-loving audience.</p>
<p>So next time, I‚Äôll probably rent a sensor instead of buying one which will end up in storage <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/im-going-on-a-travel-sabbatical-and-you-can-too/">the next time I hit the road</a>.</p>

<p>Despite the amount of time, there are plenty of new locations I scouted, but couldn‚Äôt shoot in the right conditions. If you feel like you‚Äôll ever run out of material for stunning landscape photography, I promise: you won‚Äôt.</p>
<p>Before starting this trip of a lifetime, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctUN4id-yo">I wrote about preparing for a sabbatical</a> and the importance of outlining key results. It‚Äôs not a vacation, but a <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/how-to-make-a-sabbatical-the-best-investment-of-your-life/">strategic investment</a> in your life and photography.</p>
<p><strong>So what do you do</strong> when you‚Äôve accomplished most of your sabbatical goals? ‚ÄúI want to expand my photography portfolio‚Äù isn‚Äôt enough anymore, because it leads to just that: an expanded portfolio. Nothing more.</p>
<p><strong>A few days ago I flew back to the USA</strong> to recharge, reevaluate and celebrate everything that‚Äôs happened in four months on the road. What‚Äôs next? I don‚Äôt know. I have countless stunning countries on my bucket list, but no goals to accompany them. No challenge to rise to the next level. I don‚Äôt work well that way.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nybblr"><img src="https://www.yellowscale.com/content/images/2019/03/instacollage.jpg" alt="After 4 months on the road, what‚Äôs next?"></a></p>
<p>Ironically, you can get stuck in a comfort zone when you‚Äôre constantly on the road. In the pursuit to never stop growing, sometimes leaving your comfort zone means taking an exit. And that‚Äôs okay!</p>
<p>For the same reason people hesitate to take a sabbatical seriously, it can be intimidating to take a break: what our peers think. Some folks think I am on a perpetual vacation, and can‚Äôt fathom how I could need a break from travel. As <a href="https://expertvagabond.com/quit-digital-nomad-life/">many</a> <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/the-beginning-of-the-end/">digital</a> <a href="https://indianajo.com/digital-nomad-lifestyle.html">nomads</a> will tell you, long-term travel completely changes you, and once that change is effected, things won‚Äôt be the same when you return. Things never ‚Äúgo back to normal,‚Äù because travel molds your outlook. Consequently, it shapes your future.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs why I believe in the value of <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/your-map-to-mount-nomad/">traveling now, not later</a>: it has the capacity to enrich your future. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs next for me, but I can list 30 things that will be different from before. You never ‚Äúsettle down‚Äù from travel, you simply move on to the next season.</p>
<p>That means when you need a break ‚Äî not if, but when ‚Äî <strong>take it.</strong> Take time to reevaluate what‚Äôs next in light of your experience.</p>

<p>In Exeter, I jogged to the nearby IKEA. My favorite part of IKEA‚Äôs approach to interiors isn‚Äôt so much the cute accessories or some-assembly-required shelves: it‚Äôs their willingness to depart from conventions. Why do you need a breakfast table? So what if the bed is in the kitchen?</p>
<p><strong>At the heart of design and creativity is a healthy disregard for convention.</strong> At the heart of turning dreams into achievable reality is a healthy disregard for convention‚Ä¶ <em>and what others think.</em></p>
<p>I wouldn‚Äôt trade these last 4 months for anything, because I gained much more than <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/">beautiful photos</a>. I brought back what you can‚Äôt put a price on: perspective and a changed mind. That‚Äôs a worthwhile investment, no matter what‚Äôs next.</p>
<p>What conventions are you holding onto that are handicapping your goals?</p>

I drove and walked about an hour to get set up for a composition I picked out yesterday, and waited.</p>
<p>A few minutes before sunrise, I realized I wouldn‚Äôt care for the lighting that much. It was nice, but not <em>that</em> nice: the sky was too clear, and the pinks on the horizon were subdued. So I walked back to my car and just strolled down the beautiful pebble beach at Lulworth Cove.</p>
<p>I didn‚Äôt take <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/ultralight-digital-nomad-packing-list/">my camera</a> out of the bag once all morning.</p>
<p>A year ago, I would have beat myself up and felt lousy all morning for dedicating effort to a dawn shoot and bringing back zero shots. But this morning, I actually really enjoyed myself: I felt content and peaceful as I soaked in the sunrise and listened to the waves.</p>
<p>The difference between this year and the last is understanding the <a href="https://fstoppers.com/originals/advance-your-travel-photography-spotting-these-cognitive-biases-240209">Sunk Cost Fallacy</a>: when time, money or effort is irrevocably spent, it should have no bearing on our next decision. So what if I gave up breakfast and a few hours to get here? I <strong>can‚Äôt</strong> get them back, but I <strong>can</strong> stop sinking more time and effort into it by moving on.</p>
<p>Which brings the most value right now: continuing to shoot subpar photos because of the things I gave up to get here, or enjoying a walk on a pebble beach?</p>
<p>I hope it‚Äôs a sign I‚Äôm maturing as a landscape photographer: that knowing when to quit and being able to enjoy the rest of the day means I no longer feel that a successful image is determined by a roll of the die.</p>
<p>What past investments have locked you into a mediocre path at the expense of a better avenue? Every minute is a clean slate, so what will you stop sinking your time, money and effort into?</p>

Try Light Painting in Post Production."><p>How can you bring a ‚Äúflat‚Äù image back to life? We just wrapped up a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Yellowscale">two-part vlog series</a> on light painting: a powerful way to guide your viewer‚Äôs eye to the important elements in a landscape.</p>
<p>Despite our best efforts to shoot at dramatic times of day, a raw photo often comes out looking dull, and global adjustments like exposure, contrast and color temperature won‚Äôt fix the issue.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XkTyChIY54Y" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>To recover drama in an image, you can imitate the principles of light painting in post production. We‚Äôll walk through 5 steps you can take to light paint an image:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify the <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/how-to-lead-the-eye-with-composition-shapes-and-lighting/">composition, shapes and lighting</a> in the scene.</li>
<li>Darken and cool the entire image, especially unimportant regions.</li>
<li>Paint in global adjustments, then work your way to regional adjustments.</li>
<li>Identify the natural direction and shape of light.</li>
<li>Paint in some smaller details on the subjects you identified.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="5alternativestododging">5 Alternatives to Dodging</h2>
<p>Dodging ‚Äî e.g. bumping exposure ‚Äî isn‚Äôt the only way to draw attention to a subject. In fact, it is often my least favorite technique because it tends to scrunch together tonal details and crush dynamic range.</p>
<p>Here are 5 alternatives to dodging that will help bring a photo to life with light painting.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/79blQjXH4K0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Light painting can be accomplished several ways, all with the same purpose of attracting attention to the primary regions of interest. Instead of being limited to exposure, you can use a combination of white balance, saturation, shadows, contrast and whites to draw interest to a region, or downplay unimportant areas by applying the reverse effect.</p>
<p>I find myself using light painting to the most success in images that are already exceptional straight out of the camera, but by mastering light painting in extreme situations, you‚Äôll be better equipped to apply it gingerly to your portfolio images.</p>

<ol>
<li>I‚Äôm tired of being asked ‚Äúis your house always clean?‚Äù because I don‚Äôt even have a house.</li>
<li>Can I please‚Ä¶ stop‚Ä¶ decluttering‚Ä¶ and fretting over every single thing I own now that I have 17 possessions.</li>
<li>I‚Äôm tired of having nothing to clean, because I‚Äôm never using the same floor or kitchen sink long enough to make it dirty.</li>
<li>I‚Äôm tired of feeling like such an idiot when I see my friends with a real adult life. Kids, attics, house, cars, television and a Netflix account.</li>
<li>I‚Äôm tired of people thinking I‚Äôm insane because I own next to nothing, don‚Äôt have a house or car, and have no debts. Thanks for ruining my life, Dave Ramsey.</li>
<li>I‚Äôm tired of not being allowed to use the <em>#adulting</em> hashtag since everyone thinks I‚Äôm lazy for not washing dishes I don‚Äôt have.</li>
<li>I‚Äôm tired of having no gym membership because I already get so‚Ä¶ many‚Ä¶ steps‚Ä¶ from all this hiking. The world is my treadmill.</li>
<li>I‚Äôm tired of being hungry all the time. Oh wait, I‚Äôve got a box of Clif bars here in the back seat‚Ä¶</li>
<li>I‚Äôm tired of missing coupons for Chick-fil-A because I don‚Äôt have a mailbox. Come to think of it, I can‚Äôt find a Chick-fil-A in Iceland.</li>
<li>I can‚Äôt finish the tenth reason because I‚Äôm tired of sitting on this tree stump with a view of Mt. Hood.</li>

<p>I could probably address most of these issues with a trip to T.J.Maxx, but that would require a car.</p>

It may be much more realistic than you think!</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been adopting the digital nomad lifestyle for several years, but hadn‚Äôt yet made the jump to traveling full-time. <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/the-digital-nomad-lifestyle-is-more-about-freedom-and-less-about-travel/">Being a digital nomad isn‚Äôt just about being on the road all the time</a>: it‚Äôs a lifestyle that frees you to pursue opportunities with no regrets or obligations to hold you back.</p>

<p>First, ask yourself these questions to evaluate a sabbatical:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why do you want to take this sabbatical?</strong> You need to convince yourself it‚Äôs worth it before you‚Äôll convince anyone else.</li>
<li><strong>What would a ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù sabbatical look like?</strong> Do you expect to grow your photography portfolio or foster new income sources?</li>
<li><strong>What are you giving up?</strong> Full-time salary, comforts and securities ‚Äî a sabbatical has a cost beyond your job, so count the cost and decide if you‚Äôre still willing.</li>
<li><strong>What obstacles do you need to start removing now?</strong> Debts, possessions or <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/advance-your-travel-photography-by-spotting-these-cognitive-biases/">cognitive biases</a>?

In case you missed it, we just wrapped up a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Yellowscale">two-part vlog series</a> on neutral tones. <em>Neutral tones</em> are desaturated subjects the viewer expects to be grayscale, like clouds, fog, water, snow and architecture.</p>
<p>Once you‚Äôve identified the sources of neutrals, you can take an impressive amount of creative liberty with your landscapes. There are two opposing strategies you can apply:</p>
<ol>
<li>Carefully avoid altering the neutral tones, but freely correct and enhance vibrant colors throughout the image.</li>
<li>Intentionally alter the neutral tones to convey weather, temperature and time of day while leaving the rest of the color palette alone.</li>
</ol>
<p>In both strategies, the neutral tones serve to anchor the rest of the color palette.</p>
<h2 id="1avoidalteringtheneutraltones">1. Avoid altering the neutral tones</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a9pkH3bB-ZU" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>While the vibrant colors in a sunset can be pushed far past their natural saturation before the image falls apart, it takes little adjustment to a neutral tone before the image becomes jarring. That‚Äôs because we have preconceptions of how neutral tones should appear, so even the slightest change has incredible influence over the mood of the scene.</p>
<p>Conversely, an image without neutral tones at all may look fake or unbalanced.</p>
<h2 id="2intentionallyalterneutraltones">2. Intentionally alter neutral tones</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PCCTHmoSmsc" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>In direct opposition, you can alter neutral tones to convey environmental factors without disturbing the beautiful color palette throughout the rest of the image. A tiny change to <em>only</em> neutral tones will introduce an exponential amount of mood into your image that no amount of saturation or contrast could otherwise infuse!</p>
<p>In particular, altering only the neutral tones helps convey environmental factors like the weather, temperature and time of day.</p>

I acquire with intentionality, and am twice as fast to un-acquire stuff <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/surround-yourself-with-a-few-things-you-love/">the moment it no longer brings exceptional value</a>.</p>
<p>But in one area, I‚Äôm a hopeless clutter addict: <strong>my digital life.</strong></p>
<p>After a decade of computers, I‚Äôve acquired terabytes of digital clutter. Since storage is cheap, I initially embraced a gospel of ‚Äúdelete nothing.‚Äù</p>
<p>In trying to coax family and friends into more minimalistic habits, I encouraged them to digitize everything so they could trade physical possessions for cheap digital storage.</p>
<p>What are a few backup hard drives to a garage full of unsearchable memories?</p>
<h2 id="oneisgreaterthanfour">One is greater than four</h2>
<p>That philosophy hasn‚Äôt worked well the last few years as I‚Äôve consolidated 2TB onto a 0.5TB laptop ‚Äî and in keeping with <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/your-map-to-mount-nomad/">the principle of accessibility</a>, I have no plans to carry around external drives with the other 1.5TB.</p>
<p>Now I realize storage isn‚Äôt the problem. <strong>Ownership and availability are.</strong> Just like physical possessions, every file I <em>own</em> has mental <em>ownership</em> of me. And while the practical aspect ‚Äî running out of space on three computers and selling two of them ‚Äî has forced my hand, it‚Äôs been on my mind the last few years. As I aim for accessibility and replaceability, I can‚Äôt seem to get my digital life in shape.</p>
<p>If your laptop (and backups) burned up, what would you lose? Would you have anxiety from <em>not</em> knowing the extent of the loss? If I‚Äôm preparing to lose or let go of things, I want to have a say in what goes while I have opportunity.</p>
<h2 id="goingthroughthedigitalcloset">Going through the digital closet</h2>
<p>That means letting go of files in exactly the same way I cull through possessions.</p>
<p>When decluttering a room, the easiest place to start is your wardrobe ‚Äî styles go out of style, and you can only wear one outfit at a time. In the digital realm, that meant a visit to my downloads and design asset folders that were littered with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photoshop brushes, actions and textures that I never even unzipped.</li>
<li>More themes, icons and templates than I care to admit. Did I mention I used to collect Windows Vista icon packs?</li>
<li>Design work that‚Äôs over a decade old and I will never, ever want to look at again.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1. When was the last time I used this?</strong></p>
<p>Maybe your digital life isn‚Äôt as hopeless as mine, but why on earth would I hold on to unzipped fonts and icons I downloaded 5 years ago?</p>
<p>To start my spring cleaning, I sorted by <em>Date Modified</em> or <em>Last Opened</em> to guesstimate the last time I wandered in the neighborhood.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/10/finder-downloads.png" alt="Digital clutter: cultivating an attitude of minimalism in your digital life"></p>
<p><strong>2. Will I need this in an emergency?</strong></p>
<p>Why are these files in a folder where I‚Äôll never find them? Emergency documents should be accessible and replaceable, which means they should be available online and backed up with 1Password or Dropbox.</p>
<p><strong>3. Does this bring some happiness?</strong></p>
<p>If you don‚Äôt use it and you don‚Äôt need it, it isn‚Äôt bringing happiness. Trash it.</p>
<p><strong>4. Is there already something better that duplicates its purpose?</strong></p>
<p>The downloads folder is a well-meaning sanctuary for duplicates. <code>Bench Report.xlsx</code>, <code>Bench Report (2).xlsx</code>, <code>Bench Report OLD.xlsx</code>. For every file you download, find two that should be trashed or moved to a better home. Need to archive a document for records? Convert to PDF and ditch the source document.</p>
<p><strong>Two hours later,</strong> my downloads and design asset folders are completely empty for the first time in 6 years. In sifting through thousands of files, I found 10 that were meaningful and belonged elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="lettinggoofdigitaljunk">Letting go of digital junk</h2>
<p>Before dropping from 2TB to 1TB, I had already taken practical steps to remove large files. That was easy: I just looked for old raw video files.</p>
<p>But going from 1TB to 0.5TB was infinitely harder because I needed to let the millions of little files go. Large files may weigh my hard drive down, but the millions of little ones weigh <em>me</em> down with anxiety.</p>
<p>Since becoming a digital nomad, I thought I‚Äôd gotten over I-might-need-this syndrome. However, my old design work and downloads folder were full of memories, and I liked the security of having something to reminisce over.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs the same trap <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/your-map-to-mount-nomad/">I thought I had tackled years ago</a>. It suggests two unrealistic assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>That these files are something I‚Äôll want to reminisce over.</li>
<li>That preserving all of these files in their original format is the best medium to reminisce.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scrapbooking">Scrapbooking</h2>
<p>Some of my friends love to scrapbook. For a while, I thought it was stupid ‚Äî actually, I still do ‚Äî but scrapbooking can be a powerful antidote to clutter: it coaxes you to curate hundreds of isolated memories into a cohesive highlights reel.</p>
<p>An image has far more power in a gallery collection than as a single in the closet. Scrapbooking <em>creates</em> from material you‚Äôve already <em>captured.</em> Few things have intrinsic worth: it‚Äôs what we invest that takes raw material ‚Äî family photos or old design work ‚Äî and turns them into something valuable.</p>
<p><em>Scrapbooking preserves memories in a format worth celebrating.</em> It‚Äôs not the material itself, but how you frame it.</p>
<h2 id="digitalscrapbookingforrainydays">Digital scrapbooking for rainy days</h2>
<p>In the digital world, that entails recycling old material ‚Äî photos, milestones, projects ‚Äî into a sort of ‚Äúdigital scrapbook.‚Äù While the source material might be thrown out, the scrapbook is worth holding on to for reminiscing.</p>
<p>A digital scrapbook can be just about anything: producing a performance highlight from work emails, coalescing old video clips into a YouTube montage, or uploading interior design ideas to a moodboard like <a href="https://niice.co/">Niice</a>.</p>
<p>When a ‚Äúrainy day‚Äù hits and you‚Äôre in need of encouragement, you won‚Äôt reach for reams of raw, disorganized memories. You will want to reach for a concise, meaningful digital scrapbook.</p>
<p>However, if you frequently find yourself with rainy days and reminiscing over old memories, it might be time to get out of your comfort zone to make new memories. Being comfortable is one of the dreariest, most uncomfortable stages of aging.</p>
<p>Rather than stockpiling old memories for depressing days, <strong>optimize your lifestyle for making new memories over curating the old.</strong></p>

<p>I <em>was</em> a hopeless digital clutter addict. But there just might be hope.</p>
<p>I made one final backup and set up camp on a new 512GB computer. Whether I‚Äôm away from backups for a few days or a few years, now I <em>know</em> that I have everything I need with me.</p>

<p>Like moving out of a house, moving to a new computer gets easier each time. You get in the habit of knowing exactly what you will let go of, and what carries meaning. Minimalism is about <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/surround-yourself-with-a-few-things-you-love/">making everything count</a>: anything that doesn‚Äôt, goes in the trash (folder).</p>
<p>Apart from a little baking soda, tidying up your hard drive is no different from tidying up the house.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/how-to-lead-the-eye-with-composition-shapes-and-lighting/">A few vlogs ago</a>, we broke down three ingredients of effective landscape photography:</p>
<ol>
<li>Composition</li>
<li>Shapes</li>
<li>Lighting</li>
</ol>
<p>By weaving these three elements together, we can reveal subjects spread throughout the image only as the viewer wanders through the landscape. After editing a shot for too long, it can be difficult to assess the image objectively ‚Äî one way to reset your artistic senses is to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woq3rZZsC1g">edit the image upside down</a>.</p>
<p>This week, we return to critiquing some images to break down why some images are effective at stalling the viewer‚Äôs interest. In particular, panoramas turn out to be a surprisingly difficult format to execute well and secure the viewer‚Äôs attention.</p>
<p>Whenever one element ‚Äî composition, shapes or lighting ‚Äî is missing, it‚Äôs difficult to compensate with the other two. Without enough subjects in the composition, there‚Äôs nothing for the shapes to connect, and even a perfect composition won‚Äôt mask flat lighting.</p>
<p>As you browse through your portfolio, use this critiquing process as an opportunity to <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/survivorship-bias-why-success-teaches-us-nothing/">turn photos that didn‚Äôt work out</a> into learning material so that next time, you can be more intentional.

<p>What is the first image that came to mind? A graphic design style? An interior? An empty, bleak, white-washed room?</p>
<p>Or did it make you think of a lifestyle?</p>
<h2 id="ataleoftwohouses">A Tale of Two Houses</h2>
<p>Like most of our friends and neighbors, my parents had a lot of stuff. Closets, attics, garages, kitchen cabinets‚Ä¶ filled to the brim with things that we rarely used and hoped we wouldn‚Äôt need. That stuff provided a sense of security and comfort for my parents.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm a bit contrarian: all that unused, uncatalogued stuff gave me anxiety. Closed closet doors made me want to pour over their contents to dispel their hidden mysteries. We responded differently to having lots of stuff, but my family had one universal frustration: <strong>the things we did love were drowned out by what we didn‚Äôt.</strong></p>
<p>When we entertained guests, we would spend a couple days cleaning, storing and tossing ‚Äî but with a surplus of knick-knacks, we always had the inevitable temptation to display what we loved alongside mediocre pieces. It wasn‚Äôt that we lacked stunning pieces, but that they became diluted by less stunning items that we displayed for sheer need.</p>
<p>It was a bit like merging a fine art portfolio with Instagram selfies.</p>
<p>Last week, my brother Josh moved into his new place. I have to admit, for someone who professes to care little for stuff, I‚Äôm a little envious. He has a beautiful space to work from, and with his interior design skills he could turn the space into a gallery (and sell my <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/">fine art photography</a>) or feature it on Houzz.</p>
<p>He owns very little. The space is huge and will remain empty for some time, but the few things he owns display a caliber of taste that fills up the space.</p>
<p>With Josh moved out, I resolved on my drive back to redouble my efforts to get rid of anything superfluous, especially larger furniture that would <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/the-digital-nomad-lifestyle-is-more-about-freedom-and-less-about-travel/">give me a moment‚Äôs hesitation</a>. I felt inspired to clean things up a bit, only to find:</p>
<ul>
<li>Now that I have fewer things, it feels empty.</li>
<li>The interior designer in me wants to turn my apartment into an art canvas.</li>
<li>The bathroom screams for a makeover.</li>
<li>I feel the need to fill the space up.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a space is too empty, I feel a bit lonely. When I own too much stuff, I feel attached and anxious about it holding me down. <em>The conflict that stirs within!</em> What shall I do?</p>
<h2 id="theminimalistethos">The Minimalist Ethos</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúSurround yourself with (a few) things you love.‚Äù<br>
‚ÄîMe?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Minimalism doesn‚Äôt mean owning nothing. Minimalism is an ethos: it means having nothing superfluous, and often that means choosing a few quality things over quantity. Minimalism can be framed in the negative: ‚ÄúRemove everything that is superfluous.‚Äù But sometimes I find it a bit contrary to the purpose of minimalism. So I start from the positive: ‚ÄúBe intentional about what you add: only add what brings exceptional value.‚Äù</p>
<p>What do I love, and what things make me happier? I have a handful of exceptional things, some that could be considered superfluous:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accent lighting. As a photographer, light strongly affects my mood.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/ultralight-digital-nomad-packing-list/">Travel clothes</a>, and some dressier winter wear that I probably wouldn‚Äôt travel with like a scarf and sweater from Ireland.</li>
<li>A few succulents, like lavender and ferns, that remind of my favorite places in the world.</li>
<li>Candles and soaps. Yes guys, roll your eyes ‚Äî of the five senses, the sense of smell creates the strongest ties to memories and has the strongest recall. I have a candle that smells like the Scottish Highlands and a soap like ferns in the Pacific Northwest. But ironically, my strongest memory trigger to date is a deodorant I used (and hated) while traveling non-stop for three months.</li>
<li>A few small but unique knick-knacks that carry dual value.</li>
<li>A chair that reminds me of the Alps, and a smaller desk chair that reminds me of Norway.</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of these items would be considered superfluous: extra lighting, plants and other decor accents. But ‚Äúsuperfluous‚Äù implies they bring no value, when in fact they bring exceptional value to me by making my space a place I enjoy living in ‚Äî but without holding me down.</p>
<p>Every posession you own will have a chance to posess you. Minimalism asks you to be <em>intentional</em> about every item you introduce to your life. Everything has a cost, <em>so make each one count.</em></p>

It usually includes the use of composition, shapes and lighting to encourage a viewer to rove the image in a fashion that tells a story.</p>
<p>The ‚Äúbeats‚Äù of a plot line don‚Äôt come all at once: they are spaced throughout the story to hold the viewer‚Äôs interest. And like any good story, the beats of a captivating landscape image aren‚Äôt condensed into one region of the photo.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pn8Sg1cZAGs" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Stories are hard to tell with a still image, but we can imitate a few key components of effective storytelling by slowly revealing new details and subtleties as the viewer dwells on it. It starts with composition, shapes and lighting: these aspects of an image tell a story and communicate a mood by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintaining the viewer‚Äôs interest</li>
<li>Drawing attention to the important elements</li>
<li>Helping the viewer skip past the unimportant regions</li>
</ul>
<p>To drive home these three elements, I pulled <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/">five images from my portfolio</a> and broke down why they do ‚Äî or don‚Äôt ‚Äî deliver on these three elements. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn8Sg1cZAGs">Check out the vlog for the full critique</a>, but here‚Äôs a quick peek at how I broke down these images.</p>

Growing up, anything less than an A was unacceptable to me. In college, a 4.0 was mandatory. Those expectations paid off, but didn‚Äôt work so well after academia.</p>
<p>When I started <a href="https://jonathanleemartin.com/">full-time software development</a>, that perfectionist tendency carried over. Every line of code was meticulously combed for bugs, or removed altogether during the sixth refactor. Caring about code quality is important, but at some point perfection becomes the enemy of useful: 20 near-perfect lines of code have no utility for our users until they‚Äôre shipped.</p>
<p>How do we balance craftsmanship with usefulness? In software development, the cure is to ‚Äúiterate to perfection‚Äù: get your code to 80% quality, have a colleague review the code to get it to 90%, then ship it. Over time, make that code better so it approaches perfection in the long term while still providing utility to your users.</p>
<p><strong>This year has been crazy for photography:</strong> I started writing for two online <a href="https://fstoppers.com/profile/133626/articles">photography</a> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/author/jonathan-martin/">publications</a>, vlogging on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzW75NP8kpRAC-fXKvpl-Q">YouTube</a> and blogging here. As I funnel more time and energy into landscape photography, I‚Äôm rediscovering my perfectionist tendencies. After all, photography (and writing) is an art ‚Äî what artist wants to show or publish less than perfect artwork?</p>
<p>In spending 20‚Äì30 hours a week on photography-related work, I find myself improving at shipping things that are 80% ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù out of sheer need.</p>
<p>So when I get not-infrequent comments to the effect of ‚Äúthe production quality is awful‚Äù or ‚ÄúI just wasted my time reading this,‚Äù my first instinct is bitterness. But after a few minutes, it quickly turns into self-reproach: why isn‚Äôt my work ‚Äî vlogs, articles or photos ‚Äî perfect like the old days?</p>
<p><strong>Should I dig out my old perfectionist tendencies so I can safely return to being my only critic?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúBetter to do something imperfectly than to do nothing flawlessly.‚Äù<br>
‚Äî Robert H. Schuller</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My 60% ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù a month from now will be today‚Äôs 80%. In the long term, imperfect work will become more perfect <em>while providing utility to people now.</em> The challenge is to convince myself that providing utility now is worth the unkind words.</p>
<p>I think of the small businesses and private ventures my friends operate, and realize I‚Äôm guilty: not of making discouraging comments about their efforts, <strong>but omitting to exhort them.</strong> It‚Äôs not enough to not be a jerk ‚Äî it‚Äôs my <em>privilege</em> and responsibility to encourage my peers who are <em>doing</em> things in spite of disparaging comments.</p>
<p>I have a challenge for you: this next week, <strong>pick one person or business who is doing something, and exhort them.</strong> Be their cheerleader. It‚Äôs as simple as leaving a thoughtful comment on their social media post or sending a text message. You will make their day. You may not use their product or think it‚Äôs tacky, but that‚Äôs not the point: encouraging our colleagues is the <em>least</em> we can do to invest in someone‚Äôs well-being.</p>
<p>The product ‚Äî tacky, low production quality or otherwise ‚Äî will improve with time. So invest a little of your time to feed them with the encouragement they need to stay strong.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a free, easy way to practice empathy ‚Äî and that‚Äôs a life skill we could all stand to perfect.</p>

<p>To become a successful photographer, you just need to keep up what you‚Äôre doing, right? Many photographers would give a ‚Äúyes, but‚Äù answer and rightly exhort you to reach further. The common recommendations for advancing in your craft might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shoot more often</li>
<li>Try shooting a new genre</li>
<li>Imitate another photographer‚Äôs style</li>
<li>Imitate the path of successful photographers</li>
</ul>
<p>All good advice ‚Äî except for one: ‚ÄúImitate the path of successful photographers.‚Äù</p>
<p>Wait, should we imitate <em>unsuccessful photographers</em>? Not exactly, that‚Äôs not the logical antithesis. Rather, you should concentrate on learning from <em>unsuccessful photographs</em> ‚Äî <strong>especially those in your own portfolio.</strong></p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mi31TT6DJsU" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>To motivate this, ask yourself the question: what is your objective as a photographer? Why do you spend more time in photography whenever you can?</p>
<ol>
<li>To become the best in your craft?</li>
<li>To fund your photographic endeavors?</li>
<li>To make a full-time living from photography?</li>
<li>To develop a reputation?</li>
</ol>
<p>If your current priority is to become the best in your craft, imitating successful photographers is actually the irrational way to maximize your learning. You <em>will</em> grow and you <em>can</em> be successful in your field this way, but if you want to maximize your time investment, it‚Äôs worth cultivating smarter habits that accelerate your learning.</p>
<p>Trying to learn from successes while neglecting failures is a <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/advance-your-travel-photography-by-spotting-these-cognitive-biases/">cognitive bias</a> called Survivorship Bias. It‚Äôs a selection bias: the only data-points we see are those which made it past a certain filter that imparts a bias on the data. <a href="https://medium.com/@penguinpress/an-excerpt-from-how-not-to-be-wrong-by-jordan-ellenberg-664e708cfc3d">Abraham Wald played a critical role during World War II</a> when he identified Survivorship Bias in strategies for armoring bombers.</p>
<p>Survivorship Bias is the equivalent of being handed a set of even numbers and making the observation ‚Äúoh, all these numbers are even!‚Äù You‚Äôd be absolutely right, but you‚Äôve learned no new information because the even numbers were already <em>selected.</em> What you stated was true, but yielded no new information ‚Äî like how to <em>generate</em> an even number from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>You learned nothing.</strong></p>
<p>Success stories are an example of selection bias. We only see successes ‚Äî people, photos, products ‚Äî that made it past the selection process, and that selection process imparts a non-trivial selection bias on the data-points due to marketing, timing or difficult to replicate effects.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs the same in landscape photography: when you spend your time looking at photos you consider successful, you aren‚Äôt learning much new information. After all, these photos already meet your criteria of a successful photo, but given a photo that doesn‚Äôt quite meet those criteria, you won‚Äôt know how to get there beyond starting from scratch with another photo.</p>
<p>So although you <em>can</em> grow from analyzing successful photographs, it‚Äôs far from the  <em>best</em> way to spend your learning efforts. You already have a phenomenal data source to facilitate smarter growth: all your photos you <em>didn‚Äôt</em> like from a shoot!</p>
<p><strong>Here‚Äôs how you can turn those rejected shots into actionable insights to accelerate your growth.</strong></p>
<h2 id="1takenotesinthefield">1. Take notes in the field</h2>
<p>While you scope out locations and dial in camera settings, record your brainwaves. Are you hesitating to pull out the tripod because it‚Äôs a pain to put back? What does it feel like to get out for an early dawn shoot? These are important vital signs to track: they will produce accurate, actionable course corrections sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>On my last trip to Oregon, I kept missing twilight because I was anxious about hiking back in the dark. I‚Äôve done this on so many trips without remembering to fix the issue, but this time I finally took notes to that effect. The next day, <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/ultralight-digital-nomad-packing-list/">I purchased a headlamp</a> and was able to hike fearlessly into twilight. Yes, I was stupid not to have done that before ‚Äî but I suppose being stupid is human nature.</p>
<h2 id="2journalabouttheexperience">2. Journal about the experience</h2>
<p>One or two times a day, journal about the day‚Äôs experience. Voice recording is a great way to get these out quickly and capture raw thoughts that congeal into a story. I love recapping everything that happened during the day ‚Äî random things that made me smile, frustrations and adventures. It may feel like a rehash of taking notes in the field, but I find I tend to see recurring patterns better when I take notes throughout the day and only journal once a day.</p>
<h2 id="3editphotosimmediately">3. Edit photos immediately</h2>
<p>Every day is precious, so the fastest way to improve is to close the feedback loop. I usually edit the prior shoot‚Äôs photos at noon and in the evening an hour after the sunrise or sunset shoot. Although the edit I produce is rarely exceptional, I‚Äôll quickly spot issues that I wouldn‚Äôt otherwise notice in-camera. But don‚Äôt spend too long editing the photos you like!</p>
<h2 id="4critiquerejectedphotos">4. Critique rejected photos</h2>
<p>The key to defeating survivorship bias is to spend most of your time analyzing the photos you <em>don‚Äôt</em> like.  You may be tempted to spend your time editing killer shots to perfection, but what about all the other photos you took that didn‚Äôt make the cut? Why don‚Äôt they work, and what would it take to make them work next time? You don‚Äôt want to make the same mistakes again!</p>
<p>So rather than spend all your time focusing on the photos that look great ‚Äî and are probably just like your existing portfolio ‚Äî scan only through those that didn‚Äôt quite work out.</p>
<h2 id="5holdaretrospective">5. Hold a retrospective</h2>
<p>What caused these failed shots? Did you overlook the composition? Overexpose a shot? Did you spend too long at one spot, only to find it was a bad angle? It‚Äôs not enough to pick out <em>why</em> a photo doesn‚Äôt work: you need to hypothesize <em>what</em> caused the failure!</p>
<h2 id="6writedownanactionlist">6. Write down an action list</h2>
<p>What are you going to change to squelch these issues? Write down what you are going to do differently for this evening or tomorrow‚Äôs shoot so you can close the feedback loop.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe faintest ink is more powerful than the strongest memory.‚Äù Don‚Äôt cheat yourself into thinking you‚Äôll remember to address these issues in the field, <strong>write them down.</strong> When you arrive for the shoot, explain to yourself how you are addressing each issue right now.</p>
<h2 id="beatingsurvivorshipbias">Beating survivorship bias</h2>
<p>These steps may seem like busywork, but that‚Äôs exactly why we tend to waste so much time in the learning process: we neglect the simple steps that empower us to learn with intentionality. Why take a week to learn passively from your mistakes, instead of taking one day to overcome them?</p>
<p>So take control of your learning! Learning with intentionality is one of the most rewarding ways you can get more for less as a photographer.</p>
