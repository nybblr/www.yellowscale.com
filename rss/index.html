For those who love to travel, a couple weeks off is just enough to torture your wanderlust. So if you’re in a good spot financially, you might consider a more drastic option: <strong>a travel sabbatical.</strong></p>
<p>It’s much less common in the US, but when treated like an investment, the travel sabbatical is a powerful option to recharge, invest in your career and reevaluate how you want to spend your time and money.</p>
<p>However, when I mention a travel sabbatical to burned-out colleagues, the response is usually a variation of “Are you kidding? I can’t afford that, and I’d be quitting my job. All so I can spend time lazing at a beach.”</p>
<p>I promise my rebuttal isn’t snarky, because there is truth in what they say: the average American lives beyond their means and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2017/11/18/a-foolish-take-heres-how-much-debt-the-average-us-household-owes/107651700/">carries an average debt of $137k</a>. Payments on new cars, mortgages, credit card debt, student loans — in the words of Dave Ramsey, we’re swimming in debt so we can “buy things we don’t need with money we don’t have to impress people we don’t like.”</p>
<p>The solution to our debt addiction: <strong>we are work martyrs,</strong> and our life becomes synonymous with our work. No wonder we feel dizzy at the thought of quitting a job!</p>
<h2 id="challengeyourperceptionsaboutwork">Challenge your perceptions about work</h2>
<p>The dynamic duo <a href="https://fstoppers.com/travel/feeling-burned-out-your-day-job-consider-taking-travel-sabbatical-258761">Vagabrothers</a> have some great insights into how you should approach a sabbatical, but the intro especially resonates with me because it highlights the importance of introspection. We’re heavily influenced by our peers, so we tend to take these assumptions for granted:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must own a car</li>
<li>You must own a house</li>
<li>You need a “fulfilling” career to sustain you till retirement</li>
<li>You should postpone serious travel till retirement</li>
<li>You will quit your job around 65 to retire</li>
</ul>
<p>This is definitely the tried-and-true way to live, but it’s not the one-true-way to live, nor is it the healthiest. <strong>You have a choice.</strong> It sounds trivial, but we have chained ourselves to how everyone around us lives — and we hold the key. You aren’t less of a person if you choose to take control of your time and finances.</p>
<p>In fact, I commend you. The “American Dream” isn’t all that dreamy when you tally up the debts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/01/americans-borrow-record-amounts-for-autos-even-as-interest-rates-rise.html">$31k average debt for car</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thebalance.com/average-monthly-mortgage-payment-4154282">$1k median monthly mortgage payment</a>.</li>
<li>A “fulfilling career” tends to be synonymous with workaholism.</li>
<li>Retirement is becoming an illusion as the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-10/working-past-70-americans-can-t-seem-to-retire">average retirement age goes up</a>.</li>
<li>At retirement, we are less physically able to enjoy travel and less inclined to make lifestyle changes to facilitate it.</li>
<li>The most disturbing debt: postponing travel till the tail-end of our lives robs us of the enrichment it contributes to our lives now.</li>
</ul>
<p>Life doesn’t have to happen in an office from 9 to 5, 48+ weeks per year from age 20 to 70. But you need to put your time and money into your priorities and ruthlessly evaluate anything that doesn’t align with them.</p>
<h2 id="evaluateasabbatical">Evaluate a sabbatical</h2>
<p>Assuming you are able to take a sabbatical, it’s time to ask if you are going for the right reasons and with the right expectations. We’re subject to a myriad of <a href="https://blog.yellowscale.com/advance-your-travel-photography-by-spotting-these-cognitive-biases/">cognitive biases that prevent us from reasoning correctly</a>, and the antidote is usually some introspection. So pull out a notebook and ask yourself:</p>
<p><strong>1. Why do you want to take a travel sabbatical?</strong> Like most introspective questions, the answer seems obvious until you articulate it. Do you want to see the world? Spend time recharging? Escape some rough situations at work? Save money — yes really, <a href="https://blog.yellowscale.com/want-to-travel-full-time-your-us-tax-return-might-fund-a-year-off-the-grid/">check out the FEIE</a>. Are there any options besides a sabbatical that would provide similar outcomes?</p>
<p><strong>2. What do you expect to get out of the sabbatical?</strong> You probably don’t want to just spend 6 months chilling at a beach (or maybe you do). But more likely you feel burned out <em>and</em> have other interests or career paths you want to invest in. You want to “change your life,” and that won’t happen with a 9 to 5.</p>
<p>This sabbatical is about personal growth: it’s not vacation, <strong>it’s an investment.</strong> So get some rest, but treat the sabbatical like your new full-time job. Be intentional so you can tie expenditures to measurable outcomes — there’s nothing worse than feeling aimless when you pay the hotel bills, and it’s hard to sell others on your sabbatical if you haven’t sold yourself on its tangible value.</p>
<p><strong>3. How do you want to spend your time during the sabbatical?</strong> Start building a sample itinerary and a rough breakdown of how you will spend your days. Are you going to shoot during the mornings and do a few hours of freelance writing in the afternoon? You don’t have to stick with the itinerary, but you should set realistic expectations to reference.</p>
<p><strong>4. What would make the sabbatical a “success”?</strong> Kickstarting a new career? Building up a photography portfolio? Evaluating an overseas move? Recharging your creativity? It’s a hard question to answer if you are approaching a sabbatical as an extended vacation, but even then, you should spend time qualifying what an effective vacation would do.</p>
<p><strong>5. What are you giving up?</strong> This shouldn’t come too hard since it’s the reason so few people consider a sabbatical in the first place. Before you rush to whip up a spreadsheet, list out the tangible <em>and</em> intangible things you are giving up, like job security, a decorated house and game nights with friends. There’s more at stake than just your paycheck.</p>
<p>Next, pull out a spreadsheet and tally up your current monthly expenses versus income. How would this change during a sabbatical? You’ll forfeit a full-time salary, but there’s a host of expenses that you can eliminate to compensate for the new ones you’d take on to travel. Check the numbers from an overseas vacation and use them as a guide.</p>
<p>After some number crunching, you should arrive at two numbers: your current monthly balance of expenditures to salary, and an estimated balance during the sabbatical. The difference between these two is your <strong>opportunity cost.</strong></p>
<p>This is where you put a tangible money value on that travel time. During a 6-month sabbatical, you may be able to average a similar monthly cost to your current costs, but you are also forfeiting pay. The opportunity cost analysis is a more realistic way to account for this loss.</p>
<p><strong>6. What obstacles do you need to start removing now?</strong></p>
<p>The opportunity cost analysis can be sobering, but I find it encouraging because it turns what was previously an unquantified impossibility into an achievable reality. Your next step is to start formulating action steps that will position you for a sabbatical. That might mean:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://blog.yellowscale.com/stuff-that-hasnt-ruined-my-life/">Selling hordes of clutter</a>.</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://blog.yellowscale.com/your-map-to-mount-nomad/">Adopting the digital nomad lifestyle</a>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Downsizing expenditures.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tackling your debts.</strong> I highly recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Total-Money-Makeover-Classic-Financial/dp/1595555277/?tag=nybblr08-20">The Total Money Makeover</a> by Dave Ramsey. Few things are as satisfying as the peace and freedom that comes with being debt-free!</li>
</ul>
<p>As a digital nomad, I’ve tried to position myself so that travel, photography and my software career are not in opposition, but fuel each other. It’s taken several years to get here, and I’m still a long ways off — but the journey alone has enhanced my life and enabled me to pursue opportunities I would never have imagined.</p>
<p>So even if you decide not to take a sabbatical down the road, you’ll be better off for your intentionality.</p>
<h2 id="ignorethepassiveaggressivehints">Ignore the passive aggressive hints</h2>
<p>There will always be peers who will express their disapproval: either they will be forthright, or they will fiddle with your emotional resolve through <a href="https://www.coachingpositiveperformance.com/8-examples-passive-aggressive-behaviour/">passive aggressive hints</a>. They will think you’re strange, slacking off, lazy, or all the above. But the reality is <em>you are working harder</em> to take control of your career, your time and your money.</p>
<p>Take counsel from those who have demonstrated their commitment to your well-being in the past, but ignore the naysayers who are in debt, buying expensive items they can’t afford, spending all their time working for companies that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/u-s-workers-vacation-time/index.html">don’t compensate employees more for loyalty</a>.</p>
<p><strong>You are working towards an investment</strong> — not a vacation — that is worth more to you than what you leave behind. I for one am cheering you on!</p>

It was also one of the most frustrating trips I’ve taken — but I learned so much about landscape photography, particularly about shooting with only an ultra-wide angle lens: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-EF-16-35mm-USM-Lens/dp/B00K8942SO/?tag=nybblr08-20">Canon’s 16–35mm f/4 lens</a>.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I made tons of mistakes, but learned more in 15 days than my last few trips combined. Traveling with just an ultra wide-angle lens is a powerful way to improve your landscape photography, especially your compositions.</p>

<p>A couple weeks ago, someone asked me what it meant to be a digital nomad. I rattled off a quick definition: <strong>Digital nomads are people who leverage technology to work from anywhere.</strong> They followed up with: “Why did <em>you</em> become a digital nomad?”</p>
<p>I started my usual response: that I loved to travel, that I didn’t want to be tied down, that stuff isn’t important to me. But even as I answered, I felt that didn’t cut it for my current circumstances — I haven’t traveled at all since last year, I have an apartment in Atlanta, and like most apartment tenants I own furniture and a few dishes.</p>
<p>So why am I a digital nomad? What does it mean to be a digital nomad?</p>
<p>When I look at my apartment, <a href="https://blog.yellowscale.com/stuff-that-hasnt-ruined-my-life/">I own very little</a>. The only furniture I own is a desk, mattress and IKEA bookshelf. My entire wardrobe fits in a couple IKEA baskets (super great hack by the way, dressers are overrated). It didn’t happen overnight: <a href="https://blog.yellowscale.com/your-map-to-mount-nomad/">I’ve been consolidating, selling and giving away for years</a>.</p>
<p>Is owning very little the recipe for being a digital nomad? It certainly seems like a crucial ingredient, but somehow it doesn’t feel like the hallmark.</p>
<p>I was feeling a bit nostalgic, so I hopped into my journal to do some trip planning. I started outlining how I want to spend a month in Norway, then (finally) see Iceland and do car camping. Perhaps I could see southern New Zealand’s Alps too.</p>
<p>That’s when it made sense: the reason I can make outlandish plans and expect to turn them into reality is <em>because</em> I’m a digital nomad. Owning as little as possible empowers me to drop everything with zero ties or regrets to taint the joys.</p>
<p><strong>Being a digital nomad is about safeguarding your freedom to pursue the lifestyle of your choice with as few impediments as possible, and then pursuing that lifestyle with deliberation and intentionality.</strong></p>
<p>I’m reading an inspiring article about the experience <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2138841/how-live-out-your-car">living out of a car</a>. I had considered a travel trailer before, but hadn’t sold myself on the idea of towing my life everywhere I go. Retrofitting an SUV seems like a more reasonable option to start, but the limited space borders on extreme even for me. But my favorite takeaway from the post is this gem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When you don’t own many things, you don’t worry about many things.”<br>
—Andy Cochrane</p>
</blockquote>
<p>☝️ That one sentence sums up one of the greatest freedoms of being a digital nomad. You won’t be on the road 100% of the time (I’m nowhere near). But no matter where you are, you won’t have anything stopping you from pursuing your priorities.</p>
<p>So <em>hallo</em> Norway, <em>halló</em> Iceland, and hello New Zealand. There’s no-thing stopping me.</p>

You’re not alone. 😩 Months or years after a trip, my library is still full of photos with great potential that I can’t seem to get right. <a href="https://fstoppers.com/education/nine-landscape-photography-techniques-overcome-editors-block-247524">On Fstoppers, we go in-depth on “editor’s block”</a> and techniques to get photos out of creative ruts.</p>
<p>Editor’s block is tough to get past — it’s a form of creative block because post production is one of the most creative parts of the photography workflow. The longer a photo remains in this state, the harder it becomes for us to distance ourselves from the photo to find a new perspective.</p>
<p>So how do you get landscape photos out of post-production purgatory? 🔥 <strong>Most of the techniques focus on reestablishing objectivity:</strong> after all, we’re phenomenally good at critiquing another photographer’s work because we can empathize with an audience who has never seen the photo. Objectivity is not exactly an on/off switch, but there are ways to trick our brains into thinking we’re editing a new photo!</p>
<p>Several of these techniques are borrowed from traditional drawing media, but my favorite is inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing">annealing</a> in metallurgy: <strong>randomly copy-paste settings from other edited photos!</strong> In blacksmithing, annealing refers to heating up a metal and slowly cooling it to produce a stronger result. The heat and controlled cooling allows the metal atoms to move around freely (at random) before slowly settling into the strongest formation.</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Hill_Climbing_with_Simulated_Annealing.gif" alt="9 Landscape Photography Techniques to Overcome Editor’s Block"></p>
<p>In photography, we are essentially searching for the best looking edit by modifying curves, contrast and many other sliders. With “simulated annealing,” you start editing by making completely random jumps to discover possible artistic directions, but over time focus on optimizing the better directions. When you’re stuck, you just need to make random jumps again. It’s surprisingly effective in blacksmithing… and post production!</p>
<p>So if you’re stuck editing the same photo and can't seem to figure out an edit that works, <a href="https://fstoppers.com/education/nine-landscape-photography-techniques-overcome-editors-block-247524">here are nine powerful techniques to get out of editor's block</a>. ✨</p>

<p>You probably think you’re exceptionally rational. In fact, you might say you’re more rational than average. Ironically, that perception itself is a cognitive flaw: the bias blind spot.</p>
<p>So why care about cognitive biases if everyone is affected by them? By identifying them in your own reasoning, <strong>you can advance in your craft faster.</strong> This isn’t fuzzy mumbo jumbo: cognitive biases have a measurable impact on your mood, productivity and decision making, so countering them leads to intentional, measurable progress in your field.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sunk Cost Fallacy,</strong> “I’ll just make the best of it.”</li>
<li><strong>Planning Fallacy,</strong> “I’ll improve with time.”</li>
<li><strong>Impostor Syndrome,</strong> “I’m a total fraud.”</li>
<li><strong>Observational Selection Bias,</strong> “Everyone has my camera!”</li>
<li><strong>Anchoring Effect,</strong> “But the price is reasonable?”</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve personally struggled with most of these cognitive biases <a href="https://blog.yellowscale.com/stuff-is-ruining-your-life/">during the last few years of becoming a digital nomad</a>. At first they mostly related to decluttering, but when I began working remotely full-time, I discovered just how much they affected my work productivity. With some introspection and practice, I boosted my longterm productivity enough that my coworkers and family noticed. Nowadays, <strong>I get 50% more work done in the same amount of time.</strong></p>
<p>“Well, I’ll just become a better travel photographer with time and practice.&quot;  True, but you might fall prey to the Planning Fallacy, which leads us to repeat mistakes and disregard prior experience that would otherwise yield actionable insights.</p>
<p>You deserve to get the most out of the time and money you invest in your craft, so check out the entire post on Fstoppers to learn how to <a href="https://fstoppers.com/originals/advance-your-travel-photography-spotting-these-cognitive-biases-240209">spot these biases in your day-to-day thinking and advance your travel photography</a>.</p>

Your US tax return might fund a year off-the-grid."><p>Imagine working remotely from the Alps, living in B&amp;Bs full-time as a location independent consultant. Sound like a dream only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around_the_World_in_Eighty_Days">Phileas Fogg</a> could realize? 🇺🇸 Uncle Sam may be able to help.</p>
<p>Have you filed your taxes yet? Here’s something to consider for next year’s tax return: if you are a full-time traveler, or want to become one, <strong>you can substantially reduce your US tax burden.</strong> It’s like… an incentive to travel!</p>
<p>So how does tax day work for digital nomads like travel photographers? First, don’t just skip filing: <strong>as long as you are a US citizen, you must file US taxes.</strong> You definitely don’t want expensive postcards from Uncle Sam. However, if you’re outside the US for most of the year, you may be off the hook for income taxes!</p>
<p>The TL;DR version is you can claim <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_earned_income_exclusion">Foreign Earned Income Exclusion</a> on the first $100,000 of your income if you can prove you’ve been outside the US for 330 out of 365 days (Physical Presence Test). However, this won’t get you out of the ~15% self-employment tax for Social Security and Medicare. To reduce those taxes, you need to work with an expert who can help you set up the appropriate business structure—often as a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_classification_election">foreign disregarded entity</a>.”</p>
<p>You can usually reduce your state income taxes as well, but it’s downright tricky to avoid in certain states (looking at you, California), so if you plan to turn digital nomad it is worth establishing residency in another state first.</p>
<p>I am definitely <em>not</em> an accountant and never want to be—filing this year’s 1040 murdered my soul. So don’t trust or ask for my advice. Instead, here are some fabulous resources on the nitty gritty of expat tax law:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>If you live outside the US for 330+ days of the year, get in touch with an expert who specializes in expat tax law. When you can potentially save tens of thousands of dollars, it’s worth investing in a professional who knows what they’re doing so you don’t get in trouble with Uncle Sam.</p>
<p>Some back-of-the-hand math suggests I could easily cover the cost of living difference abroad—plus flights, AirBnBs, car rentals—with that money. <em>Happy tax day indeed!</em></p>
<p>My excuses for not traveling full-time are disappearing. 💸 One year off the grid, anyone?</p>

The other half is consolidating my kit so I can travel light <a href="https://blog.yellowscale.com/your-map-to-mount-nomad/">as a digital nomad</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s what my camera kit looks like for landscape photography trips—<a href="https://blog.yellowscale.com/stuff-that-hasnt-ruined-my-life/">my clothes fit in there too</a>!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Frame-Full-HD-Digital-Camera/dp/B007FGYZFI/?tag=nybblr08-20">Canon 5D Mark III</a></strong>. Someday I’ll probably switch to a mirrorless like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Full-frame-Mirrorless-Interchangeable-Lens-ILCE7M3K/dp/B07B45D8WV/?tag=nybblr08-20">Sony a7 III</a>, but till then the 5D performs flawlessly.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.magiclantern.fm/">Magic Lantern</a></strong>. It’s free and replaces a shutter release, intervalometer and more. Just make sure to have an extra SD card <a href="https://blog.yellowscale.com/photo-journal-spirit-falls/">in case it misbehaves</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-EF-16-35mm-USM-Lens/dp/B00K8942SO/?tag=nybblr08-20">Canon 16–35mm F/4 lens</a></strong> with hood. I used the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-24-105mm-USM-Zoom-Lens/dp/B000B84KAW/?tag=nybblr08-20">24–105mm</a> for the last 5 years, but it will stay at home now since <a href="https://fstoppers.com/originals/how-fit-your-gear-and-clothes-one-bag-travel-indefinitely-226731">I only travel with one lens</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-Professional-1066x-CompactFlash-LCF32GCRBNA10662/dp/B00IQCRTQ2/?tag=nybblr08-20">Lexar 1066x CompactFlash cards</a></strong>. Your memory cards need to be rock-solid reliable after thousands of miles traveled and dollars spent. And with Magic Lantern, these cards are fast enough to <a href="https://vimeo.com/139290481">shoot gorgeous RAW footage</a>. Still, I’m looking forward to a mirrorless camera so I can just use cheaper SD cards.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-Professional-USB-Dual-Slot-Reader/dp/B00WBK03OU/?tag=nybblr08-20">CompactFlash card reader</a></strong>. Cheap readers can corrupt CF cards, so it’s worth spending a few extra dollars for a reputable one.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-9486B002-Battery-Pack-LP-E6N/dp/B00NI3CSIS/?tag=nybblr08-20">1 extra battery</a></strong>. The 5D’s impressive battery life usually lasts a couple days, but more than once I’ve forgotten to charge it.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kaesemann-Circular-Polarizer-Multi-Resistant-Coating/dp/B00OK6YSAS/?tag=nybblr08-20">B+W CPL filter</a></strong>. I have the previous generation, but B+W recently released an upgraded polarizer that cuts out less light and is cheaper.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/1-8-64x-Multi-Resistant-Coating-Camera-66-1089230/dp/B01MRU56X0/?tag=nybblr08-20">B+W 6-stop ND filter</a></strong>. I own a 10-stop filter as well, but since it’s rarely called for I have stopped packing it altogether.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sirui-T2205X-Tripod-Section-Height/dp/B004WY7W42/?tag=nybblr08-20">Sirui T-2205X Carbon Fiber Tripod</a></strong>. I’ve been through three tripods, and this one strikes the perfect balance between stability and ultralight portability. And the twist locks are fantastic!</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sirui-K-20X-Ball-Head-Black/dp/B004QC3COO/?tag=nybblr08-20">Sirui K-20x Ball Head</a></strong>. Arca-style, rock solid, medium weight ball head that won’t break your camera or the bank.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Peak-Design-Black-Camera-SL-BK-3/dp/B0781QV3H4/?tag=nybblr08-20">Peak Design camera straps</a></strong> (in testing). After hating on some cheap shoulder straps, I returned to Canon’s neck strap, but nowadays I’m testing out Peak Design’s straps. Keep an eye open for updates!</li>
<li><strong>Two microfiber cloths</strong>. Just steal them from an Apple fanboy.</li>
<li><strong>Compact 2TB backup drive</strong>. During photography trips, I keep three up-to-date backups of my photos. The hard drive usually stays at the hotel for safekeeping.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://photographygloves.com/product/vallerret-photography-glove-pro-17/">Vallerret fingerless merino wool gloves</a></strong>. Fingers are the first thing to freeze, so I consider these part of my photography kit.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/03/one-bag-packing-list.jpg" alt="What’s in My Camera Bag for Landscape Photography?"></p>
<p>There are a few things you <strong>won’t</strong> find in my photography kit:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Second camera body</strong>. If the worst happens and my camera drowns, I’ll have to expedite a replacement. Meantime, I’d rather travel light so my gear is less likely to be stolen.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple lenses</strong>. I own a second lens, but travel with just one. It’s just too painful to swap lenses out in the elements, especially when a single wide-angle lens covers 95% of my landscape portfolio.</li>
<li><strong>Lens cleaning kit</strong>. The polarizing filter pretty much lives on my lens, so I just make due with microfiber cloths.</li>
<li><strong>GPS module</strong>. Instead, I use my iPhone as a GPS logger.</li>
<li><strong>Shutter release or intervalometer</strong>. Thanks, Magic Lantern!</li>
<li><strong>Lighting equipment</strong>. I have flashes and modifiers for shooting portraiture, <a href="https://fstoppers.com/originals/how-fit-your-gear-and-clothes-one-bag-travel-indefinitely-226731">but when traveling I razor focus my shoot genre</a> to landscape photography.</li>
<li><strong>Drone</strong>. Video drones are too big for my carry on and compete with my time shooting landscape photography. Perhaps the next version of the DJI Mavic?</li>
<li><strong>Tools</strong>. TSA frowns on multitools, so all of my equipment must go together and disassemble without allen wrenches.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it! My camera gear lives in the same bag as the rest of my travel entourage—<a href="https://fstoppers.com/originals/how-fit-your-gear-and-clothes-one-bag-travel-indefinitely-226731">here’s the entire packing list</a>.</p>

<p>Sadly, I had exhausted the accessible landmarks around Mount Hood and the Columbia River Gorge. My original destination, Bend Oregon, was swamped in snow. North of the gorge, Mount Rainier was locked in snow. I texted home for recommendations for a nearby region that wasn’t in a second ice age.</p>
<p>“I want to see mountains, Gandalf. Lakes and vistas too. Any recommends, hobbits?”</p>
<p>“Did you see Spirit Falls, precious?”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/34542719710/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/03/spirit-falls-alt.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: Spirit Falls"></a></p>
<p>Just north of the Oregon-Washington border lies one of the truly hidden gems of the Columbia River Gorge. Spirit Falls has no public trail, and until recently the only known trail down the steep gorge crossed illegally into private land.</p>
<p>I drove to the bend in the road described in a hiking forum, but found the shoulder peppered with signs, “No public access to Spirit Falls.” Defeated by a sign! I hopped in the car to head back to Oregon, but first decided to do a little more research on the forums.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/03/spirit-falls-gorge.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: Spirit Falls"></p>
<p>A fellow hiker mentioned an alternate trail in the comments section. He described a steep descent which skirts around the property and goes through an area owned by a hiker-friendly company. It was definitely an at-your-own-risk path with some steep muddy spots that my hamstrings sharply protested. But with GPS and careful footing (or kayaking), it was much easier than descriptions of the previous (illegal) path.</p>
<p>I was the only one in the gorge all morning. The trees and pounding mist made it difficult to find a composition my 24–105mm lens could squeeze in, but Spirit Falls was easily the most idyllic falls in the region. Simply stunning.</p>

<p>I think my camera was also thrilled: it crashed three times.</p>

Trillium Lake was on my bucket list, and according to Google Maps would only be a half mile off the main road.</p>
<p>I made a quick stop by a ranger station just outside Hood River to pick up a “sno park” permit, then made the haul out to Government Camp. The highway was a bit dicey in places, but fabulously inspirational as it wove through the Mount Hood National Forest.</p>
<p>When I pulled into the Trillium Sno Park, I didn’t take much notice of all the folks with snow shoes and skiing equipment. Word on the street was that the snow had a nice coating of ice on top and would be easy to walk without snow shoes.</p>
<p>“And the lake is close, it’s just about a quarter of a mile walk,” a fellow hiker cheerfully reassured as he pulled his ski equipment out of a 4WD SUV.</p>
<blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/BSXKU9aAZJZ/"></blockquote>
<p>Close to the trailhead, the snow was indeed easy enough to walk on. But after two miles of laboring into steadily soggier snow (mostly downhill), I still hadn’t reached the lake.</p>
<p>At this point, the snow behaved eerily like quicksand. Every step was succeeded by a fall of three feet; more than once I lost my footing altogether and had trouble lifting myself out of waist deep snow.</p>

<p>After a few trials and backtracking, I found a path to the lake. Sadly, it was a disappointing view—to get a proper view of Mount Hood in the background, I would need to hike a couple more miles around the frozen lake.</p>

<p>Naive southerner that I was, I wimped out.</p>
<p>Three miles later of drowning in uphill snow, I made it back to the car with zero photos to show for my efforts. My only takeaways were a few iPhone panos and a newfound phobia of snow. I spent the rest of the afternoon in a coffeeshop perusing my photographic spoils.</p>
<p>On the way back to my B&amp;B in Hood River, I passed a small airfield with a fantastically clear view of Mount Hood. With it’s snow-capped peak, “The Mountain” is easily one of the most photogenic mountains in the USA, and commands the horizon from 50 miles away.</p>

<p>Till then I had struggled to find an unobscured view of Mount Hood, and ironically one of the clearest was just down the street from my stay. My B&amp;B host wrapped up an eventful day with an invitation to join some guests for dinner and games.</p>
<p>I checked in with my folks to boast of my conquests: seven feet of snow, closed roads and seafood. “You would’ve been proud of me, today I had smoked grilled salmon.”</p>

<p>I decided to tack on a week of photography to the end of a business trip in Portland, and made Hood River my home base. The Columbia River Gorge deserves its own journal, but the wet drive from Portland to Hood River can be mostly summed up in six falls, four drenchings and a few mudslides.</p>
<p>I stopped off at a coffeeshop in Hood River overlooking the Columbia River and Oregon–Washington border. Quite a romantic setting.</p>

<p>Driving to my AirBnB a few minutes away felt like discovering a cabin—it was a large, plainly furnished room down a dirt road that’s not even on Google Maps.</p>
<p>My experience at a nearby old-fashioned gas station wasn’t as decidedly atmospheric. I hesitated when they asked for my credit card and pumped for me, but I was equally grateful that they washed the windows while I waited. When in Oregon…</p>
<p>On recommendation, I had an exceptional dinner at The Mesquitery. The sides—not to mention the chicken schnitzel—were my favorite meal of the trip. Guessing by the accent, giant portions and pierogi, the owners seemed Polish.</p>

<p>Despite the year’s unusually heavy snowfall, my host mentioned that the road to Lost Lake was rumored to be accessible. So my first morning in Hood River, I drove through the snow packed forest roads to Lost Lake.</p>
<p>There was a road closure a few miles out.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/02/snow-walls.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: Lost Lake at Mount Hood"></p>
<p>“So don’t tell anyone… but I just drove 5 miles past the warning.” My brother wasn’t too fazed by my text. I drove within a quarter mile of the lake before hitting solidly iced roads, then hiked the last stretch atop seven feet of snow to this lonely, snowy paradise. Thanks to a solid layer of ice on top, I didn’t snow pole much—a circumstance I foolishly took for granted.</p>

<p>I’m rarely reckless, but I blame the fantastic setting: the deep green woods, the overwhelming smell of ferns and a light chill felt like poetry.</p>
<p>I cautiously snapped some panoramas while trying not to sink into underground picnic tables. A tripod was out of the question, but with some blending and stitching I ended up with a 20-shot panorama of Mount Hood.</p>

<p>I texted my brother again once I made it back to the car.</p>
<p>“My heart is going thump right now. All I can say about this morning is: wow. This has been a nearly life changing experience—I feel in my element =D”</p>

<p>The prior night, we drove the long haul from Devonshire to the hills of north Wales and Snowdonia National Park—a fairly intense in the dark.</p>
<p>I had the car to myself the following day (yay!), so I drove at random through the park. Snowdonia’s eerily Alpine roads echo the mood of Yosemite and the Scottish Highlands. But like Ireland, conditions and lighting change rapidly.</p>
<blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/BZiswCSgNwi/"></blockquote>
<p>I couldn’t imagine a better place to build my castle in the air. I can't help but feel Snowdonia is an underrated photographer’s haven—and I wouldn’t mind it staying that way!</p>
<p>About midday I drove to the idyllic South Stack Lighthouse on Holy Island. Despite the time of day, it was a fairly successful first visit and I figured I’d “gotten the shot,” so I drove back to Caernarfon for some coffee to weather the rain.</p>
<blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/BZgTXEnAAqV/"></blockquote>
<p><em>(Yes, technically this latte was in Sheffield—I decided not to snap an insta and look like a dork in every coffeeshop.)</em></p>
<p>Of course, the second visit is <em>always</em> better, so after passing the afternoon in a coffeeshop, I ended up at the lighthouse a second time—this time about an hour shy of sunset.</p>
<p>My earlier visit was smallcakes in comparison. Just as golden hour approached, I watched a thick fog roll in. I nearly abandoned the shoot altogether—it was thick enough to completely obscure the sunset and lighthouse. But still, it was mesmerizing to watch the blanket of fog roll in and out with almost magical rapidity.</p>
<p>The mood was there, even if the lighthouse wasn’t.</p>
<p>The scene suddenly cleared, and while the lighthouse became visible, a remainder of thick fog clung to the rocks in the foreground. Thankfully my shot was already composed, so I started the 60-second exposure.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/39717789032/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/02/south-stack-lighthouse.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: South Stack Lighthouse in Wales"></a></p>
<p>By the second shot, the lighthouse was completely invisible again.</p>
<p>This was probably the best unexpected shoot of the trip—I  figured the thick fog would ruin the shot, so I certainly didn’t expect to get a <em>better</em> photo than what I already had!</p>
<p>It was wild to observe such rapid changes in the weather, and I couldn’t help feeling that a leprechaun had followed me from Ireland to resettle in north Wales.</p>
<p>Wise leprechaun.</p>
