<p>You probably think you’re exceptionally rational. In fact, you might say you’re more rational than average. Ironically, that perception itself is a cognitive flaw: the bias blind spot.</p>
<p>So why care about cognitive biases if everyone is affected by them? By identifying them in your own reasoning, <strong>you can advance in your craft faster.</strong> This isn’t fuzzy mumbo jumbo: cognitive biases have a measurable impact on your mood, productivity and decision making, so countering them leads to intentional, measurable progress in your field.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sunk Cost Fallacy,</strong> “I’ll just make the best of it.”</li>
<li><strong>Planning Fallacy,</strong> “I’ll improve with time.”</li>
<li><strong>Impostor Syndrome,</strong> “I’m a total fraud.”</li>
<li><strong>Observational Selection Bias,</strong> “Everyone has my camera!”</li>
<li><strong>Anchoring Effect,</strong> “But the price is reasonable?”</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve personally struggled with most of these cognitive biases <a href="https://blog.yellowscale.com/stuff-is-ruining-your-life/">during the last few years of becoming a digital nomad</a>. At first they mostly related to decluttering, but when I began working remotely full-time, I discovered just how much they affected my work productivity. With some introspection and practice, I boosted my longterm productivity enough that my coworkers and family noticed. Nowadays, <strong>I get 50% more work done in the same amount of time.</strong></p>
<p>“Well, I’ll just become a better travel photographer with time and practice.&quot;  True, but you might fall prey to the Planning Fallacy, which leads us to repeat mistakes and disregard prior experience that would otherwise yield actionable insights.</p>
<p>You deserve to get the most out of the time and money you invest in your craft, so check out the entire post on Fstoppers to learn how to <a href="https://fstoppers.com/originals/advance-your-travel-photography-spotting-these-cognitive-biases-240209">spot these biases in your day-to-day thinking and advance your travel photography</a>.</p>

Your US tax return might fund a year off-the-grid."><p>Imagine working remotely from the Alps, living in B&amp;Bs full-time as a location independent consultant. Sound like a dream only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around_the_World_in_Eighty_Days">Phileas Fogg</a> could realize? 🇺🇸 Uncle Sam may be able to help.</p>
<p>Have you filed your taxes yet? Here’s something to consider for next year’s tax return: if you are a full-time traveler, or want to become one, <strong>you can substantially reduce your US tax burden.</strong> It’s like… an incentive to travel!</p>
<p>So how does tax day work for digital nomads like travel photographers? First, don’t just skip filing: <strong>as long as you are a US citizen, you must file US taxes.</strong> You definitely don’t want expensive postcards from Uncle Sam. However, if you’re outside the US for most of the year, you may be off the hook for income taxes!</p>
<p>The TL;DR version is you can claim <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_earned_income_exclusion">Foreign Earned Income Exclusion</a> on the first $100,000 of your income if you can prove you’ve been outside the US for 330 out of 365 days (Physical Presence Test). However, this won’t get you out of the ~15% self-employment tax for Social Security and Medicare. To reduce those taxes, you need to work with an expert who can help you set up the appropriate business structure—often as a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_classification_election">foreign disregarded entity</a>.”</p>
<p>You can usually reduce your state income taxes as well, but it’s downright tricky to avoid in certain states (looking at you, California), so if you plan to turn digital nomad it is worth establishing residency in another state first.</p>
<p>I am definitely <em>not</em> an accountant and never want to be—filing this year’s 1040 murdered my soul. So don’t trust or ask for my advice. Instead, here are some fabulous resources on the nitty gritty of expat tax law:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.whereverwriter.com/digital-nomad-tax-questions/">Digital Nomad Tax Questions Answered by a U.S. Tax Attorney</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ustax.bz/how-to-structure-your-non-u-s-business-or-profession/">How to Structure Your Non-US Business or Profession</a></li>

</ul>
<p>If you live outside the US for 330+ days of the year, get in touch with an expert who specializes in expat tax law. When you can potentially save tens of thousands of dollars, it’s worth investing in a professional who knows what they’re doing so you don’t get in trouble with Uncle Sam.</p>
<p>Some back-of-the-hand math suggests I could easily cover the cost of living difference abroad—plus flights, AirBnBs, car rentals—with that money. <em>Happy tax day indeed!</em></p>
<p>My excuses for not traveling full-time are disappearing. 💸 One year off the grid, anyone?</p>

The other half is consolidating my kit so I can travel light <a href="https://blog.yellowscale.com/your-map-to-mount-nomad/">as a digital nomad</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s what my camera kit looks like for landscape photography trips—<a href="https://blog.yellowscale.com/stuff-that-hasnt-ruined-my-life/">my clothes fit in there too</a>!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Frame-Full-HD-Digital-Camera/dp/B007FGYZFI/?tag=nybblr08-20">Canon 5D Mark III</a></strong>. Someday I’ll probably switch to a mirrorless like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Full-frame-Mirrorless-Interchangeable-Lens-ILCE7M3K/dp/B07B45D8WV/?tag=nybblr08-20">Sony a7 III</a>, but till then the 5D performs flawlessly.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.magiclantern.fm/">Magic Lantern</a></strong>. It’s free and replaces a shutter release, intervalometer and more. Just make sure to have an extra SD card <a href="https://blog.yellowscale.com/photo-journal-spirit-falls/">in case it misbehaves</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-EF-16-35mm-USM-Lens/dp/B00K8942SO/?tag=nybblr08-20">Canon 16–35mm F/4 lens</a></strong> with hood. I used the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-24-105mm-USM-Zoom-Lens/dp/B000B84KAW/?tag=nybblr08-20">24–105mm</a> for the last 5 years, but it will stay at home now since <a href="https://fstoppers.com/originals/how-fit-your-gear-and-clothes-one-bag-travel-indefinitely-226731">I only travel with one lens</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-Professional-1066x-CompactFlash-LCF32GCRBNA10662/dp/B00IQCRTQ2/?tag=nybblr08-20">Lexar 1066x CompactFlash cards</a></strong>. Your memory cards need to be rock-solid reliable after thousands of miles traveled and dollars spent. And with Magic Lantern, these cards are fast enough to <a href="https://vimeo.com/139290481">shoot gorgeous RAW footage</a>. Still, I’m looking forward to a mirrorless camera so I can just use cheaper SD cards.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-Professional-USB-Dual-Slot-Reader/dp/B00WBK03OU/?tag=nybblr08-20">CompactFlash card reader</a></strong>. Cheap readers can corrupt CF cards, so it’s worth spending a few extra dollars for a reputable one.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-9486B002-Battery-Pack-LP-E6N/dp/B00NI3CSIS/?tag=nybblr08-20">1 extra battery</a></strong>. The 5D’s impressive battery life usually lasts a couple days, but more than once I’ve forgotten to charge it.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kaesemann-Circular-Polarizer-Multi-Resistant-Coating/dp/B00OK6YSAS/?tag=nybblr08-20">B+W CPL filter</a></strong>. I have the previous generation, but B+W recently released an upgraded polarizer that cuts out less light and is cheaper.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/1-8-64x-Multi-Resistant-Coating-Camera-66-1089230/dp/B01MRU56X0/?tag=nybblr08-20">B+W 6-stop ND filter</a></strong>. I own a 10-stop filter as well, but since it’s rarely called for I have stopped packing it altogether.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sirui-T2205X-Tripod-Section-Height/dp/B004WY7W42/?tag=nybblr08-20">Sirui T-2205X Carbon Fiber Tripod</a></strong>. I’ve been through three tripods, and this one strikes the perfect balance between stability and ultralight portability. And the twist locks are fantastic!</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sirui-K-20X-Ball-Head-Black/dp/B004QC3COO/?tag=nybblr08-20">Sirui K-20x Ball Head</a></strong>. Arca-style, rock solid, medium weight ball head that won’t break your camera or the bank.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Peak-Design-Black-Camera-SL-BK-3/dp/B0781QV3H4/?tag=nybblr08-20">Peak Design camera straps</a></strong> (in testing). After hating on some cheap shoulder straps, I returned to Canon’s neck strap, but nowadays I’m testing out Peak Design’s straps. Keep an eye open for updates!</li>
<li><strong>Two microfiber cloths</strong>. Just steal them from an Apple fanboy.</li>
<li><strong>Compact 2TB backup drive</strong>. During photography trips, I keep three up-to-date backups of my photos. The hard drive usually stays at the hotel for safekeeping.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://photographygloves.com/product/vallerret-photography-glove-pro-17/">Vallerret fingerless merino wool gloves</a></strong>. Fingers are the first thing to freeze, so I consider these part of my photography kit.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/03/one-bag-packing-list.jpg" alt="What’s in My Camera Bag for Landscape Photography?"></p>
<p>There are a few things you <strong>won’t</strong> find in my photography kit:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Second camera body</strong>. If the worst happens and my camera drowns, I’ll have to expedite a replacement. Meantime, I’d rather travel light so my gear is less likely to be stolen.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple lenses</strong>. I own a second lens, but travel with just one. It’s just too painful to swap lenses out in the elements, especially when a single wide-angle lens covers 95% of my landscape portfolio.</li>
<li><strong>Lens cleaning kit</strong>. The polarizing filter pretty much lives on my lens, so I just make due with microfiber cloths.</li>
<li><strong>GPS module</strong>. Instead, I use my iPhone as a GPS logger.</li>
<li><strong>Shutter release or intervalometer</strong>. Thanks, Magic Lantern!</li>
<li><strong>Lighting equipment</strong>. I have flashes and modifiers for shooting portraiture, <a href="https://fstoppers.com/originals/how-fit-your-gear-and-clothes-one-bag-travel-indefinitely-226731">but when traveling I razor focus my shoot genre</a> to landscape photography.</li>
<li><strong>Drone</strong>. Video drones are too big for my carry on and compete with my time shooting landscape photography. Perhaps the next version of the DJI Mavic?</li>
<li><strong>Tools</strong>. TSA frowns on multitools, so all of my equipment must go together and disassemble without allen wrenches.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it! My camera gear lives in the same bag as the rest of my travel entourage—<a href="https://fstoppers.com/originals/how-fit-your-gear-and-clothes-one-bag-travel-indefinitely-226731">here’s the entire packing list</a>.</p>

<p>Sadly, I had exhausted the accessible landmarks around Mount Hood and the Columbia River Gorge. My original destination, Bend Oregon, was swamped in snow. North of the gorge, Mount Rainier was locked in snow. I texted home for recommendations for a nearby region that wasn’t in a second ice age.</p>
<p>“I want to see mountains, Gandalf. Lakes and vistas too. Any recommends, hobbits?”</p>
<p>“Did you see Spirit Falls, precious?”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/34542719710/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/03/spirit-falls-alt.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: Spirit Falls"></a></p>
<p>Just north of the Oregon-Washington border lies one of the truly hidden gems of the Columbia River Gorge. Spirit Falls has no public trail, and until recently the only known trail down the steep gorge crossed illegally into private land.</p>
<p>I drove to the bend in the road described in a hiking forum, but found the shoulder peppered with signs, “No public access to Spirit Falls.” Defeated by a sign! I hopped in the car to head back to Oregon, but first decided to do a little more research on the forums.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/03/spirit-falls-gorge.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: Spirit Falls"></p>
<p>A fellow hiker mentioned an alternate trail in the comments section. He described a steep descent which skirts around the property and goes through an area owned by a hiker-friendly company. It was definitely an at-your-own-risk path with some steep muddy spots that my hamstrings sharply protested. But with GPS and careful footing (or kayaking), it was much easier than descriptions of the previous (illegal) path.</p>
<p>I was the only one in the gorge all morning. The trees and pounding mist made it difficult to find a composition my 24–105mm lens could squeeze in, but Spirit Falls was easily the most idyllic falls in the region. Simply stunning.</p>

Trillium Lake was on my bucket list, and according to Google Maps would only be a half mile off the main road.</p>
<p>I made a quick stop by a ranger station just outside Hood River to pick up a “sno park” permit, then made the haul out to Government Camp. The highway was a bit dicey in places, but fabulously inspirational as it wove through the Mount Hood National Forest.</p>
<p>When I pulled into the Trillium Sno Park, I didn’t take much notice of all the folks with snow shoes and skiing equipment. Word on the street was that the snow had a nice coating of ice on top and would be easy to walk without snow shoes.</p>
<p>“And the lake is close, it’s just about a quarter of a mile walk,” a fellow hiker cheerfully reassured as he pulled his ski equipment out of a 4WD SUV.</p>
<blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/BSXKU9aAZJZ/"></blockquote>
<p>Close to the trailhead, the snow was indeed easy enough to walk on. But after two miles of laboring into steadily soggier snow (mostly downhill), I still hadn’t reached the lake.</p>
<p>At this point, the snow behaved eerily like quicksand. Every step was succeeded by a fall of three feet; more than once I lost my footing altogether and had trouble lifting myself out of waist deep snow.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/03/snow-signs.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: Mount Hood"></p>
<p>After a few trials and backtracking, I found a path to the lake. Sadly, it was a disappointing view—to get a proper view of Mount Hood in the background, I would need to hike a couple more miles around the frozen lake.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/03/trillium-lake.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: Mount Hood"></p>
<p>Naive southerner that I was, I wimped out.</p>
<p>Three miles later of drowning in uphill snow, I made it back to the car with zero photos to show for my efforts. My only takeaways were a few iPhone panos and a newfound phobia of snow. I spent the rest of the afternoon in a coffeeshop perusing my photographic spoils.</p>
<p>On the way back to my B&amp;B in Hood River, I passed a small airfield with a fantastically clear view of Mount Hood. With it’s snow-capped peak, “The Mountain” is easily one of the most photogenic mountains in the USA, and commands the horizon from 50 miles away.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/33960400990/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2017/12/185A4102.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: Mount Hood"></a></p>
<p>Till then I had struggled to find an unobscured view of Mount Hood, and ironically one of the clearest was just down the street from my stay. My B&amp;B host wrapped up an eventful day with an invitation to join some guests for dinner and games.</p>
<p>I checked in with my folks to boast of my conquests: seven feet of snow, closed roads and seafood. “You would’ve been proud of me, today I had smoked grilled salmon.”</p>

<p>I decided to tack on a week of photography to the end of a business trip in Portland, and made Hood River my home base. The Columbia River Gorge deserves its own journal, but the wet drive from Portland to Hood River can be mostly summed up in six falls, four drenchings and a few mudslides.</p>
<p>I stopped off at a coffeeshop in Hood River overlooking the Columbia River and Oregon–Washington border. Quite a romantic setting.</p>
<blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/BSeFqZzA-4x/"></blockquote>
<p>Driving to my AirBnB a few minutes away felt like discovering a cabin—it was a large, plainly furnished room down a dirt road that’s not even on Google Maps.</p>
<p>My experience at a nearby old-fashioned gas station wasn’t as decidedly atmospheric. I hesitated when they asked for my credit card and pumped for me, but I was equally grateful that they washed the windows while I waited. When in Oregon…</p>
<p>On recommendation, I had an exceptional dinner at The Mesquitery. The sides—not to mention the chicken schnitzel—were my favorite meal of the trip. Guessing by the accent, giant portions and pierogi, the owners seemed Polish.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/02/dinner.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: Lost Lake at Mount Hood"></p>
<p>Despite the year’s unusually heavy snowfall, my host mentioned that the road to Lost Lake was rumored to be accessible. So my first morning in Hood River, I drove through the snow packed forest roads to Lost Lake.</p>
<p>There was a road closure a few miles out.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/02/snow-walls.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: Lost Lake at Mount Hood"></p>
<p>“So don’t tell anyone… but I just drove 5 miles past the warning.” My brother wasn’t too fazed by my text. I drove within a quarter mile of the lake before hitting solidly iced roads, then hiked the last stretch atop seven feet of snow to this lonely, snowy paradise. Thanks to a solid layer of ice on top, I didn’t snow pole much—a circumstance I foolishly took for granted.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/34193853240/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/02/lost-lake.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: Lost Lake at Mount Hood"></a></p>
<p>I’m rarely reckless, but I blame the fantastic setting: the deep green woods, the overwhelming smell of ferns and a light chill felt like poetry.</p>
<p>I cautiously snapped some panoramas while trying not to sink into underground picnic tables. A tripod was out of the question, but with some blending and stitching I ended up with a 20-shot panorama of Mount Hood.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/38904686934/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/02/mount-hood-over-lost-lake.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: Lost Lake at Mount Hood"></a></p>
<p>I texted my brother again once I made it back to the car.</p>
<p>“My heart is going thump right now. All I can say about this morning is: wow. This has been a nearly life changing experience—I feel in my element =D”</p>

<p>The prior night, we drove the long haul from Devonshire to the hills of north Wales and Snowdonia National Park—a fairly intense in the dark.</p>
<p>I had the car to myself the following day (yay!), so I drove at random through the park. Snowdonia’s eerily Alpine roads echo the mood of Yosemite and the Scottish Highlands. But like Ireland, conditions and lighting change rapidly.</p>
<blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/BZiswCSgNwi/"></blockquote>
<p>I couldn’t imagine a better place to build my castle in the air. I can't help but feel Snowdonia is an underrated photographer’s haven—and I wouldn’t mind it staying that way!</p>
<p>About midday I drove to the idyllic South Stack Lighthouse on Holy Island. Despite the time of day, it was a fairly successful first visit and I figured I’d “gotten the shot,” so I drove back to Caernarfon for some coffee to weather the rain.</p>
<blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/BZgTXEnAAqV/"></blockquote>
<p><em>(Yes, technically this latte was in Sheffield—I decided not to snap an insta and look like a dork in every coffeeshop.)</em></p>
<p>Of course, the second visit is <em>always</em> better, so after passing the afternoon in a coffeeshop, I ended up at the lighthouse a second time—this time about an hour shy of sunset.</p>
<p>My earlier visit was smallcakes in comparison. Just as golden hour approached, I watched a thick fog roll in. I nearly abandoned the shoot altogether—it was thick enough to completely obscure the sunset and lighthouse. But still, it was mesmerizing to watch the blanket of fog roll in and out with almost magical rapidity.</p>
<p>The mood was there, even if the lighthouse wasn’t.</p>
<p>The scene suddenly cleared, and while the lighthouse became visible, a remainder of thick fog clung to the rocks in the foreground. Thankfully my shot was already composed, so I started the 60-second exposure.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/39717789032/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/02/south-stack-lighthouse.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: South Stack Lighthouse in Wales"></a></p>
<p>By the second shot, the lighthouse was completely invisible again.</p>
<p>This was probably the best unexpected shoot of the trip—I  figured the thick fog would ruin the shot, so I certainly didn’t expect to get a <em>better</em> photo than what I already had!</p>
<p>It was wild to observe such rapid changes in the weather, and I couldn’t help feeling that a leprechaun had followed me from Ireland to resettle in north Wales.</p>
<p>Wise leprechaun.</p>

But in a world crisscrossed by millions of tourists, what is left to explore and savor to ourselves—somewhere we won't fight against a crowd of selfie-snapping tourists?</p>
<p>The rising popularity of lifestyles that indulge this yearning—digital nomadism, minimalism—highlights our desperation for these unsullied havens. These places are not bucket list tourist destinations: they’re next door, up a mountain or down a snow-covered back road. They can’t be reached by train, bus or flight: they’re a car ride, walk and hike away. It’s not always a comfortable or well-paved route to get there—exactly what we need to weed out tourists.</p>
<p>Since first stepping across the Atlantic <a href="https://blog.yellowscale.com/19-tips-for-international-travelers-adventurers-edition/">4 years ago</a>, I've found that such havens are usually free and at their best:</p>
<ol>
<li>Out of season</li>
<li>At an unpopular time of day</li>
<li>In uncomfortable weather</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are 10 of my favorite havens across Europe and the US. If you see something you like, I do prints! Just ping me on <a href="https://twitter.com/nybblr">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yellowscale">Facebook</a>.</p>
<h2 id="imanowarbeachengland">I. Man O’War Beach (England)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/24394880678/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2017/12/185A6923.jpg" alt="Wish You [Weren’t] Here"></a></p>
<p>The Jurassic Coast is one of the most photogenically dense regions of England. Most adventurers head for Durdle Door in Dorset, but despite the door’s instant appeal, it is surprisingly boring and difficult to shoot a unique angle.</p>
<p>Luckily, the real beauty of this region is just a few steps east: the Man O’War Beach. Unlike Durdle Door which favors sunset, the beach’s lighting is best just before sunrise. I scoped the area out before the 6am dawn; the fiery morning clouds looked like finger-combed cotton candy.</p>
<p>It’s great to have dawn to yourself, but it was equally delightful to meet a few dedicated photographers who drove all night from Manchester to arrive in time for the light show!</p>
<h2 id="iigimmelwaldswitzerland">II. Gimmelwald (Switzerland)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/30437504430/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2017/12/185A0574.jpg" alt="Wish You [Weren’t] Here"></a></p>
<p>Gimmelwald is a tiny Swiss hill town that lies at the foot of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungfrau-Aletsch_protected_area">Jungfrau</a> above Lauterbrunnen. The better known tourist destination of Mürren is just 30 minutes away on foot, but lacks the remote charm that Gimmelwald offers.</p>
<p>Accommodations in the area are less than breathtaking, but at night the surrounding mountains and lights throughout the village transform an otherwise commonplace Alpine setting into a magical mountain haven!</p>
<h2 id="iiistrumbleheadlighthousewales">III. Strumble Head Lighthouse (Wales)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/38089576732/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2017/12/185A6611.jpg" alt="Wish You [Weren’t] Here"></a></p>
<p>After a week in Ireland, we took the south ferry to cross over to Wales and the Pembrokeshire Coast. We loitered about St. Davids for most of the day trying to escape the drizzle (and tourists) by flitting from coffee shop to gift shop before we finally resolved to go shoot Strumble Head Lighthouse.</p>
<p>I felt truly alive when we pulled up to the lighthouse—a fast moving ceiling of clouds, drizzly fits and idyllic rocks. It was wet work, but I can't recall a time I was more happy to be drenched.</p>
<p>It even compensated for the treacherous night drive back: many of the roads were completely flooded, turning a 30 minute drive into 1.5 hours of blindly backing up hedged country roads and trying to avoid minor roads.</p>
<h2 id="ivgeroldseegermany">IV. Geroldsee (Germany)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/32487513255/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2017/12/185A2716.jpg" alt="Wish You [Weren’t] Here"></a></p>
<p>Geroldsee is probably one of the better known “untouristy” spots of the region, thanks to its lake and chalets. On our last day in Germany, we stayed in the nearby town of Farchant.</p>
<p>I was feeling exceptionally lazy due to a fever, so we almost didn't make the 30 minute drive. I'm glad we did! By the time I found the right viewpoint, the sun peeked out to give one last (and my favorite) impression of Bavaria.</p>
<h2 id="vpeitlerkofelitaly">V. Peitlerkofel (Italy)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/32946472550/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2017/12/185A1735.jpg" alt="Wish You [Weren’t] Here"></a></p>
<p>On our way to Lago di Braies from Santa Magdalena, we passed some cabins at the foot of the Sass de Putia (Peitlerkofel in German) right off the main road. It’s one of those spots you’d never find without driving—but it characterizes the blend of Italian, Austrian and Swiss culture of the Alpine region.</p>
<h2 id="vilostlakeoregonusa">VI. Lost Lake (Oregon, USA)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/34193853240/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2017/12/185A3980.jpg" alt="Wish You [Weren’t] Here"></a></p>
<p>Visiting the Pacific Northwest is guaranteed to be an adventure, but in early spring it is doubly so due to the region’s “microclimates.” My first morning in Hood River, I drove through the snow packed forest roads to Lost Lake. There was a road closure a few miles out, but I was able to get within a quarter mile of the lake and hiked the last stretch (atop seven feet of snow) to this lonely, snowy paradise.</p>
<h2 id="viispiritfallswashingtonusa">VII. Spirit Falls (Washington, USA)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/33879529964/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2017/12/185A4126.jpg" alt="Wish You [Weren’t] Here"></a></p>
<p>Just north of the Oregon-Washington border lies one of the truly hidden gems of the Columbia River Gorge. Spirit Falls has no public trail, and until recently the only known trail crossed illegally into private land.</p>
<p>Don't worry, there's now a legal path thanks to the hiker-friendly business that owns a large chunk of the land, albeit it's definitely an at-your-own-risk path with some steep spots. But with some careful footing (or kayaking), this is easily the most idyllic falls in the region.</p>
<h2 id="viiibrunateitaly">VIII. Brunate (Italy)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/24074457289/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2017/12/185A9224.jpg" alt="Wish You [Weren’t] Here"></a></p>
<p>On our second day in Como, we took the funicolare to the little hill town of Brunate.</p>
<p>We had trouble finding the funicolare, and just as the sun was getting ready to set, we met a man who had lived on the outskirts of Como his whole life. He was incredibly friendly and walked us down to the station. Thanks to his kindness, we reached the top within 5 minutes of the nautical twilight!</p>
<p>Though the picture doesn't do the landscape justice, this was probably my favorite view from our entire trek through Italy. The little hill towns of Italy hide remarkable beauty!</p>

<p>I'm not one for photographing European villages—I prefer their envious landscapes—and usually keep my camera packed up while perusing the shops and gelaterias. But away from the city center you can always find tight, windy roads that characterize the Italian way.</p>
<h2 id="xmounthoodoregonusa">X. Mount Hood (Oregon, USA)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/33960400990/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2017/12/185A4102.jpg" alt="Wish You [Weren’t] Here"></a></p>
<p>The Pacific Northwest is just so outstanding, it deserves one last shout out. Easily one of the most photogenic mountains in the USA, Mount Hood and its snow-capped peak commands the horizon from 50 miles away.</p>
<p>“The Mountain” is probably the first natural landmark I had ever wanted to photograph since purchasing my first DSLR 6 years ago, so it was amazing to spend 6 days in the region. I had trouble getting a clear view the first couple days, but a local airfield in Hood River obliged my camera.</p>

<p>It’s easy to observe <em>someone else’s</em> life transformation. When a muffin-top friend disappears for 6 months and comes back trim and buff, the “rapid” transformation belies the difficult steps needed to reproduce the end result. Seeing change isn’t enough to accomplish it—you have to commit to a methodical (and often radical) plan.</p>
<p>In some ways, digital nomadism is like getting in shape: we can easily envy our clutter-free friends and their world expeditions, but achieving a similar situation can be daunting. But even if you aren’t ready to travel the world, you can start “getting in shape” today!</p>
<p><a href="https://500px.com/photo/180936001/jungfrau-over-gimmelwald-by-jonathan-martin"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/12/185A0574.jpg" alt="Becoming a Digital Nomad starts today, not tomorrow."></a></p>
<h2 id="1adoptthemindset">1. Adopt the mindset.</h2>
<p>The nomadic mindset is independent of where you live. If you can feel like you aren't living out of a suitcase when you travel, you can eventually embrace a similar lifestyle at home.</p>
<p>Hipsters try to be different for the sake of being different. But fads change, so before long term lifestyle changes begin to pay off, they may cease to be trendy. Consequently, digital nomadism is not a “hipster” thing; like getting in shape, worthwhile lifestyle changes take time. So research what you’re in for, then work towards the goal. <em>Don’t just be different for the sake of it.</em></p>
<p>That said, be prepared to diverge from cultural norms. Most people have only sampled a few dots within 30 degrees of longitude, so the majority of our conceptions come from a tiny sliver of the 360 degree globe.</p>
<p>Some people become nomads expecting travel to bring them the happiness that possessions cannot. But travel can be like work: it may bring you enjoyment, pleasure and occupation, <em>but not contentment.</em> If you aren’t content now, don’t expect to be content for long as a digital nomad.</p>
<h2 id="2recognizecognitivebiases">2. Recognize cognitive biases.</h2>
<p>I grew up in the South, so getting in shape is hard if you don’t first recognize an “eat everything on your plate” mentality and consciously fight it.</p>
<p>Ownership has its own assortment of these mentalities, but before you can break them, you have to recognize generational habits and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias">cognitive biases</a>.</p>
<p><strong>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs">Sunk cost</a>”</strong> is a widespread bias that dramatically affects decision making, especially when paired with a “waste not, want not” attitude. Say you purchased an expensive coffee table a year ago, but now it just doesn’t work with the decor. The rational decision would be to sell or give the item away, but as “you might need it someday” it would be a waste to toss something you paid so much money for, so you might opt to store it.</p>
<p>But ownership also has a cost: you might inconvenience the garage (and your toes) for years before finally tossing the table, or rack up professional mover fees. This is an example of a <strong>sunk cost</strong>—whether you keep it or toss it, you have already paid for the table and are unlikely to recover the costs. So the feeling of “losing money” shouldn’t affect your decision—sometimes getting rid of stuff pays for itself in emotional well-being! Don’t add to your losses by punishing yourself for costs you can’t recoup.</p>
<p>The <strong>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well_travelled_road_effect">Well travelled road effect</a>”</strong> is the tendency to perceive familiar habits (like driving routes) as faster or more effective than alternate options, despite hard numbers to the contrary. It’s the same reason we tend to resist learning new things as we age. “Your way” is always better than Google Maps because it’s the route you’ve always taken, but what new discoveries are you forfeiting? Make an effort to be uncomfortable, and in time you may find yourself comfortable with discomfort.</p>
<h2 id="3getcomfortablewithless">3. Get comfortable with less.</h2>
<p>Your comforts reflect your deepest fears.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The more comforts you have, the more your comforts have you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The American Dream is a shmorgishborg of “indispensable” comforts: hot water, air conditioning, private transportation and laundry facilities. But the most transformative adventures don’t always happen when there’s a hot shower nearby.</p>
<p>Comfort goes beyond hygienic conveniences: are you uncomfortable working on the go without a dedicated keyboard, mouse or monitor? A checked bag? If your productivity is directly tethered to a WiFi connection, it can be difficult to work remotely. With <a href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/">key remappers</a>, careful packing and good offline tooling you might find that you were unnecessarily tied down by conveniences that only prevented you from learning better workflows.</p>
<p>When you need less to be comfortable, you are less likely to forget something.</p>
<h2 id="4tightenupbordersecurity">4. Tighten up border security.</h2>
<p>Immigrant clutter should have a rough time getting through customs to your home. Do not become a sanctuary for well-meaning but misplaced things.</p>
<p>Try the “1 in, 2 out rule.” Whenever you make a purchase, donate what it replaces and ditch one other thing. Naturally, you’ll start to bias your purchasing decisions towards things that take the place of multiple things.</p>
<p>“Clutter” includes email and snail mail. When you receive either, do your wallet a favor and unsubscribe immediately. Magazines and email campaigns are designed not only to clutter inboxes, but to tantalize your materialistic yearnings.</p>
<h2 id="5deportexistingclutter">5. Deport existing clutter.</h2>
<p>Preventing inbound clutter is straightforward, but the real challenge is removing the decades of junk you already own. This can take years, but with the right mindset it can become second nature and inform your buying habits.</p>
<p>If you are hesitant to declutter because you will be moving to a larger house, consider that if you don’t have enough room for your things now, <em>you never will.</em> Humans are bad at spatial estimation, so overflowing closets in a tiny apartment are a mere foreshadowing of the unholy rubbish that will consume your future 3-story house.</p>
<p>The safest category to start with is clothing: if you toss half your wardrobe, you’re unlikely to upset your spouse. Moreover, you can quickly cultivate the virtue of indifference with just a few cleanings. Here’s the decision tree:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>When did I last wear this?</strong> Specific dates are your pal in spring cleanings. It you haven’t worn it in 12 months, no questions asked. <strong>Donate it.</strong> Otherwise…</li>
<li><strong>Will I need this for a special occasion?</strong> This is a deceptive question: if the answer is “no,” that’s easy confirmation, but it’s usually “yes” even if you actually won’t ever wear it. We forget that life is not organized like our clothes rack. <strong>Donate it.</strong> Otherwise…</li>
<li><strong>Is there another article I would always prefer wearing over this?</strong> Second-rate multiples rarely get worn, and by the time they are called for your tastes will have changed. <strong>Donate it.</strong></li>
<li>Otherwise, keep it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furniture is difficult to cull. The easiest cure is prevention: focus on creating a modest, well-rounded ensemble. So instead of purchasing 3 bookshelves to fill up a big room, invest in 1 bookshelf, 1 couch, 1 rug, etc. An assortment of pieces can adapt to different spaces more readily than a trio of duplicates. If any item unfairly infringes on the negative space, store the offending article; a well-designed room does not need excess furniture to feel “finished.” If it is uncalled for after a few months, it’s time to part ways. This is also a good time to bias towards furniture you can easily move with a friend’s help.</p>
<h2 id="6virtuesofremainingcitizens">6. Virtues of remaining citizens.</h2>
<p>After a couple years of decluttering and curbing buying habits, your remaining possessions will hopefully exhibit exemplary virtues.</p>
<h3 id="spontaneity">Spontaneity</h3>
<p>The best things happen <s>when you’re dancing</s> when you can embrace spontaneity. When an unexpected trip means adventure instead of inconvenience, digital nomadism begins to pay off. Thus, it’s important to choose equipment that frees you to travel.</p>
<p>Could you pack for a couple weeks out of the country in 15 minutes? It’s a daunting benchmark, but you can prepare for international trips by streamlining coffee stops and overnight visits. For myself, that meant consolidating my photography equipment and wardrobe into a compact kit. For my mom, it meant switching from glasses to contacts and replacing two purses with a money belt. For artists, it could mean familiarizing yourself with digital art programs like <a href="http://procreate.si/">Procreate</a> to replace an inconvenient gaggle of art mediums.</p>
<p>With daytrips as a way to gauge yourself, you can decide what you absolutely need at all times to enjoy spontaneous adventures.</p>
<h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h3>
<p>Your remaining possessions and records aren’t much use if you can’t access them when you need them.</p>
<p>Start by digitizing everything—ideally, the only paper you own should be green and issued by the Federal Reserve. I had enough stacks of paperwork and sheet music to cover half my bedroom, but it was well worth a few days of scanning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sheet music</li>
<li>Bank statements</li>
<li>Tax forms</li>
<li>Sketches</li>
</ul>
<p>With a good backup plan (more on that later), digital copies are better than reams of paper! Image Capture and <a href="https://readdle.com/products/scannerpro">Scanner Pro</a> are great for scanning documents.</p>
<p>Now with everything digitized and backed up, it needs to be accessible from anywhere. You can rely on web services like Dropbox and Gmail, but don’t forget that you may not always have an Internet connection. For sensitive documents, <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> is worth its price tag when paired with Dropbox for syncing; moreover, the free 1Password mobile app stores a copy of your documents so you can access them offline.</p>
<p>Is your phone loaded with important text messages, like directions or addresses, that you wouldn’t be able to access in a pinch? Travel reservations should be backed up and easily accessible offline. I use the <a href="https://www.tripit.com/">TripIt</a> app to track all of my travel reservations, but sometimes the app doesn’t pick up all the details I may need (like barcodes or check-in instructions), so <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> and iBooks are a great last resort.</p>
<h3 id="replaceability">Replaceability</h3>
<p>As a frequent traveler, it is inevitable something important will be damaged or stolen. Losing a phone or laptop is a very real concern for those who create their life’s work on a fragile arrangement of silicon and plastic. How much data would be lost? How long would it take to set up a brand new device and get it work ready?</p>
<p>The moment of doom is not a great time to discover just what money <em>can’t</em> buy. Don’t put yourself in a position where your life would end in cardiac arrest if any of your equipment croaked.</p>
<p>For many with the flexibility of a nomadic lifestyle, data is your most valuable possession. Protect it with the <strong><a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/">3-2-1 backup strategy</a>:</strong> create 3 independent backups with 2 external hard drives and an online service like <a href="https://www.crashplan.com/">CrashPlan</a> for your 3rd backup.</p>
<p>When swapping out equipment becomes a non-event, you’ve achieved Replaceability. After 3 laptops and 7 clean reinstalls of macOS, my personal configuration takes little time to replicate thanks to <a href="https://github.com/nybblr/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> and a <a href="https://gist.github.com/nybblr/0bb105c7b1eba4c54da5">macOS configuration script</a>.</p>

<h2 id="yourturn">Your turn!</h2>
<p>The nomadic lifestyle eliminates worry while enabling you to take advantage of life’s unforeseeable opportunities, and it’s a mindset that you can adopt now! So don’t wait until you decide you’re ready to travel—prepare for it now, and you may find it to be a lifestyle that befits you even at home.</p>
<p>Get comfortable with less, eliminate sources of inbound clutter and attach a cost to existing items. Your reward for a well-culled “stuff life” is a quality portfolio that is accessible anywhere, easy to replace and friendly to spontaneity.</p>

<p>Last time, <a href="https://blog.yellowscale.com/2016/10/15/stuff-is-ruining-your-life/">we mused on the downsides of owning too much stuff</a>. During my foray into digital nomadism, I’ve consolidated what I do and don’t need to live at home or on the go. Here are <strong>24 things I intentionally own and don’t own as a digital nomad.</strong></p>
<h2 id="12thingstokeep">12 things to keep</h2>
<p><strong>1. Quality clothes.</strong> Why own 25 cotton tees that fit so-so and are miserable in hot weather, instead of owning 5 shirts that look great and are made of materials that perform well in inclement weather? For travel, I follow the three-layer system: 3 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Icebreaker-Merino-Everyday-Sleeve-Crewe/dp/B00AF6ZKL8/?tag=nybblr08-20">Icebreaker merino wool shirts</a> for the base layer, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Patagonia-Mens-Down-Sweater-Hoodie/dp/B073RP8KSK/?tag=nybblr08-20">Patagonia down jacket</a> for the mid layer, and an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Outdoor-Research-Helium-Jacket-Glacier/dp/B005BV87WQ/?tag=nybblr08-20">Outdoor Research Helium rain jacket</a> for the outer layer. Whether I’m headed for 80 degrees or 20 degrees, I’m covered.</p>
<p>I have a dressier wardrobe for business trips, but I avoid 100% cotton and opt for polyester/nylon blends that can survive the rigors of travel and sink washes. All told, my entire closet (blazer included) fits in a carry-on sized duffel bag.</p>
<p><strong>2. Tiny laptop.</strong> I’m a fulltime software developer and photographer living off a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EIUDHGG/?tag=nybblr08-20">12” MacBook</a>. Unless I need to do serious video editing, the 12” handles my work and hobby needs with a form factor and weight that are simply unbeatable.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if I’m at home or on the go—the outlets are always in the wrong place. I pack a cheap flathead extension cord so I can squeeze it behind furniture and charge a few other devices simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>3. Laptop daypack</strong> for travel and day trips. I use a 17 liter North Face daypack (discontinued, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/North-Face-Jester-Backpack-Black/dp/B00OS67V6S/?tag=nybblr08-20">here’s a larger one</a>), and thanks to a strict packing regime it holds everything I need for indefinite travel!</p>
<p><strong>4. Hammock.</strong> I ousted the traditional European mattress for an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ENO-Eagles-Nest-Outfitters-DoubleNest/dp/B001DDPGNO/?tag=nybblr08-20">ENO doublenest camping hammock</a>. This makes for a fun table-talk topic! I won’t belabor why hammocks make an awesome bed, <a href="http://www.criticalcactus.com/hammock-sleeping-benefits/">as other folks have done a much better job</a>.</p>
<p><strong>5. Standup desk.</strong> My living is made at a desk, so a quality piece of furniture that supports me for 9+ hours a day is worth the space and investment. I owned a <a href="https://www.geekdesk.com/sit-to-stand-adjustable-height-desk-v3">GeekDesk</a> for a few years, but since I rarely changed height I’ve replaced it with a cheaper handcrank desk.</p>
<p><strong>6. Car phone charger.</strong> A dying smartphone in a new country is a sure-fire way to strain an already stretched day from timezones and layovers. However, setting it on fire with a cheap charger is also ill-advised, so stick with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-PowerDrive-iPhone-Galaxy/dp/B00VH84L5E/?tag=nybblr08-20">well-reviewed chargers</a>.</p>
<p><strong>7. Smartphone.</strong> Without it and a cornucopia of apps, I’d be too chicken to step off the plane! Paired with a good data plan, I can tether my laptop to truly work from anywhere. Here’s a smattering of apps on my phone’s home screen:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wallet</strong> for plane tickets.</li>
<li><strong>1Password</strong> for secure access to copies of my IDs, credit cards and passwords.</li>
<li><strong>Google Maps ± Waze</strong> for getting places. <a href="https://support.google.com/maps/answer/6291838">Offline maps is downright lifesaving</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Google Translate</strong> because it’s fun to use the offline mode to spew out bits of German or Polish!</li>
<li><strong>Google Calendar</strong> because working from anywhere hasn’t made timezones second nature yet.</li>
<li><strong>TripIt</strong> for organizing all my travel reservations in one app for offline access.</li>
<li><strong>White Noise</strong> to block out noisy hotel neighbors without packing a noise maker.</li>
<li><strong>Cash</strong> for fee-free person-to-person payments in the US.</li>
<li><strong>Slack</strong> for real-time chat with my colleagues.</li>
<li><strong>Gmail</strong> because Apple mail doesn’t handle labels well.</li>
<li><strong>Dropbox</strong> for quick backups and file transfers.</li>
<li><strong>iBooks</strong> so I can finish reading Charles Dickens and J.R.R. Tolkien.</li>
<li><strong>Uber</strong> for convenient rides throughout the US.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>8. Internet connectivity</strong> is a non-negotiable for my job and vacations alike. I rely on connectivity to get directions, translations and make reservations. I’m still waiting for <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/11/spacex-plans-worldwide-satellite-internet-with-low-latency-gigabit-speed/">satellite internet</a> to become affordable and portable, but meantime I settle for so-so data coverage. If you’re savvy, you can purchase a prepaid SIM card to save on data charges, <a href="http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/Prepaid_SIM_with_data">but be prepared for some homework</a>. For now, I make due with T-Mobile’s included roaming.</p>
<p><strong>9. Exercise routine.</strong> Staying healthy on the move is tough, but regular aerobics, weight training and stretching make my body more resilient during back-to-back travel. I have been using the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/P90X3-DVD-Workout-Base-Kit/dp/B00TQ8FSWC/?tag=nybblr08-20">P90X3 workouts</a> for 6 months—about half the exercises require nothing more than a carpeted floor, but the rest need only a pull-up bar and hand weights.</p>
<p><strong>10. Just enough comforts to welcome friends.</strong> I was raised in the South, so hospitality was a big part of growing up. Unfortunately, hospitality seems to clash with my minimalist habits, so I’ve settled on a few tokens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some good games</li>
<li>Candles and lighting to set the mood</li>
<li>A place for friends at the table</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>11. “Third place”</strong> other than home or the office where I am a regular, like a coffee shop or coworking space. Especially when traveling alone, this gives me a regular way to connect with people and feed off the collective synergy when I need a productivity boost.</p>
<p><strong>12. TSA-friendly sick kit.</strong> The immune system hits an all-time low when traveling. Mundane ailments like headaches and allergies have compact remedies: hand soap under 3 oz., ibuprofen, loratadine, herbal tea bags, and a miracle heating pad that helps with headaches, cramps, aches and chills: <em>a rice bag.</em> <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Rice-Sock">Rice bags are trivial to make</a>: double up a couple baseball socks and fill it with cheap rice, then warm it in the microwave for a few minutes.</p>
<h2 id="12thingstoditch">12 things to ditch</h2>
<p><strong>1. Big closets.</strong> Stuff requires storage space, and storage space invites more stuff—it’s a disturbingly recursive relationship.</p>
<p><strong>2. Large wardrobe.</strong> If it takes more than a minute to pick an outfit in the morning, I either have too many good choices or—more often the case—too many uncoordinated options. As a courtesy to myself, I only keep the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Icebreaker-Merino-Everyday-Sleeve-Crewe/dp/B00AF6ZKL8/?tag=nybblr08-20">clothes I unreservedly love to wear</a>: then any choice is a surefire winner!</p>
<p><strong>3. Shoe gallery.</strong> Shoes take up a lot of space, so a gaggle of single purpose pairs makes for a lousy packing experience. I pack loafers for business, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Merrell-Mens-Gore-Tex-Hiking-Chocolate/dp/B001FYVMCA/?tag=nybblr08-20">waterproof Merrell hiking shoes</a> for everything else. I’m not sold on the look, but hiking shoes are definitely my go-to travel shoes.</p>
<p><strong>4. Loaded dishwasher.</strong> “The dishes are piling up in the sink, Honey!” The more dishes I own, the longer I spend washing them. Instead, I prefer to own just a few (nice) dishes that double as decor—who needs cabinets?</p>
<p><strong>5. Furniture outlet.</strong> Furniture won’t head move out as easily as I will for my next adventure. If I can’t comfortably move it myself or with a friend’s help, it has no business in my life; I’d rather invest the money and time in my next trip!</p>
<p><strong>6. TV service.</strong> With the rise of services like Netflix, it’s easy to find movies on demand without obscene commercials. So why waste an average of $99/month and 35 hours a week on the tube?</p>
<p><strong>7. TV screen.</strong> Since I’ve opted out of television service, I enjoy titles right off my laptop. It’s also a welcome incentive to play games, enjoy conversation or read books together when friends are over. Old-fashioned? Yessir, and right nice it is.</p>
<p><strong>8. Stereo system.</strong> I do love playing background music for guests, so I may opt for a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Original-Sonos-Play-streaming-Compatible/dp/B00EWCUK1Q/?tag=nybblr08-20">Sonos speaker</a> someday, but a 5.1 surround sound system is not in the forecast.</p>
<p><strong>9. Home phone.</strong> Mobile phones are ubiquitous, and when I need high quality audio I rely on VoIP solutions like Google Voice. No need to send change-of-phone-number notices!</p>
<p><strong>10. (Fancy) car.</strong> Sitting in traffic and keeping up with maintenance can be stressful—not to mention costly. Can you carpool? Bike to the office? Take public transit? For now, a personal vehicle is my cheapest option, but I know that an <em>expensive</em> car is not in my future.</p>
<p><strong>11. Magazine-cover bed.</strong> Sleep is important, but a 300-pound king-sized bed is probably 95% fashion statement and 5% a good night’s sleep. I’d rather take a minimalist approach for my “happy place” than splurge on a space I won’t want to leave for a new adventure.</p>
<p><strong>12. Paper records.</strong> Not even sticky notes. Reams of paper are an information crisis waiting to happen—a good <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/">3-2-1 digital backup plan</a> is always a better solution.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>That’s it!</strong> Other than my violin and <a href="https://blog.yellowscale.com/whats-in-my-camera-bag-for-landscape-photography/">camera equipment</a>, that’s pretty much everything I own. It’s taken time to recognize some cognitive quirks and consolidate this far, <a href="https://blog.yellowscale.com/your-map-to-mount-nomad/">so next time we’ll focus on the mindset and process</a> for clearing out the hobbit hole!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“...strange!”</p>
<p>“...Hipster.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And “generally sick.”</p>
<p><strong>“Next you’ll put your bed in your closet,”</strong> my family has told me more than once. (They’re probably right.)</p>
<p>Before adopting the nomadic mindset, I hated traveling. Scrutinizing crumbling sculptures and searching for B&amp;B’s at 2 AM never appealed to me.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://500px.com/nybblr">Then I took up photography</a>.</strong> Suddenly new scenery, new cultures and new experiences fascinated me. In just under three years, I’ve trekked through Scotland, Germany, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, Poland and a handful of (mid)western states.</p>

<p>This newfound interest in long-term travel exposed many shortcomings in my materialistic existence. I don’t own much, but it’s enough to make a three-month trip abroad a logistical nightmare.</p>
<p>This reality hit me when my family moved from Atlanta, where we had lived for 18 years. We spent 2 years emptying the attic/basement/garage, cleaning out moldy nooks and consolidating our wardrobes.</p>
<p><strong>The final move was <em>still</em> a nightmare.</strong></p>
<p>There was certainly no way our family could uproot to another state on a whim, much less another continent. <strong>There was just way too much stuff.</strong> We didn’t want or need most of it, but it had become part of our lives. And while I wasn’t the worst offender, it still might take a dozen Advil just to move my own stuff.</p>
<p>If I wanted to travel long-term—to spend a few weeks in Germany, fly to Greenland for the weekend, then hang out in Monterey for the summer—my closet had to downsize.</p>
<p>I found myself questioning every item in my room. Even with my lean habits and (what I considered extreme) regular consolidation, I still found I had a lot of “stuff” that I didn’t really need. <strong>Why was I attached to things that caused me anxiety and stress?</strong> Was I just being extreme? Over-the-top OCD about owning too much stuff?</p>
<p>Or, was I rubbing up against an unhealthy cultural “norm”—one that frowns on an empty house?</p>
<h2 id="meldingmindsets">Melding mindsets.</h2>
<p>I assumed I was just eccentric, but after two years of moves and travels, I’ve realized that <em>culture</em> has conditioned me with the wrong expectations.</p>
<p>Armed with experience from international trips, I began to pack smarter and lighter, bringing only what I would use on a daily basis (accounting for a trip to the laundromat).</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.yellowscale.com/2016/01/06/19-tips-for-international-travelers-adventurers-edition/">As I began to nail effective packing,</a> I considered an unorthodox challenge: <strong>if I can live this way comfortably for a few weeks internationally, could I embrace this minimalistic mindset all the time?</strong> Could I break myself away from extraneous conveniences and comforts that don’t really enhance my daily existence?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Anything you cannot relinquish when it has outlived its usefulness possesses you, and in this materialistic age a great many of us are possessed by our possessions.”<br>
—Peace Pilgrim</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our materialistic society loudly advertises an endlessly growing list of “must-haves.” <em>“You need a roomy house, car, entertainment center and clothes.”</em> Ironically, running that through a translator a few times yields a much more honest, <em>“You need a crippling mortgage, car payment, cable bill and an unhealthy obsession with brimming closets.”</em></p>
<p>These things aren’t enhancing life—they are stealing it from us, and the comfort they offer is usually outweighed. <strong>“Whatever you have, has you.”</strong> Too many possessions, and our lives become squandered in meaningless maintenance and worry.</p>
<p>Maybe if we got out of our closets and away from the TV, <strong><a href="https://blog.yellowscale.com/2016/04/20/yosemite-national-park/">we could experience life instead of a commercial</a>.</strong></p>
<h2 id="appraisingyourthings">Appraising your things.</h2>
<p>Ask yourself how devastated you would be if your apartment burned to the ground. How much of your life would the flames steal?</p>
<p>Getting rid of stuff is hard, but if you can boil your clutter intuitions down to some common factors, you’ll find decluttering much easier.</p>
<p>Things hold value for a few different reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>They enable new experiences.</strong> Camera equipment powers my photography, and a nice dining room table facilitates hospitality.</li>
<li><strong>They are aesthetic by nature</strong> and thus intrinsically enjoyable. Pleasing decor or nice candles can brighten up your day.</li>
<li><strong>They preserve memories</strong> of an experience. Antiques remind you of a loved one, and outfits may hasten you back to overseas shopping treks with a friend.</li>
<li><strong>They make life comfortable.</strong> A dishwasher and a couch make life pleasant.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best things in life help you do all of these, but my nomadic side favors the first bullet most: <strong>experience enabling.</strong></p>
<h2 id="qualifysuccesswithgoalorientedmetrics">Qualify success with goal-oriented metrics.</h2>
<p>As an experience-driven person, I need to qualify what a successful nomadic lifestyle looks like for me. In particular, I want to be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comfortably travel for several weeks out of a backpack.</li>
<li>Live comfortably in one place.</li>
<li>Pack confidently for an international trip in under an hour.</li>
<li>Move my life in a sedan (excluding furniture) when I move between apartments.</li>
<li>Take a trip within a trip with little repacking or prior planning.</li>
<li>Burn my home down with little adverse affect. Although I don’t recommend arson, it’s a useful thought experiment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Am I there yet? Not by a long shot, but now I know exactly how to hold my materialism in check to make sure I’m not accumulating more junk.</p>
<h2 id="perhapsnomadismisntyourthing">Perhaps nomadism isn’t your thing.</h2>
<p>You’ve read this far, but before we skydive further into the nomadic lifestyle, let’s make sure I’m not wasting your time.</p>
<p>This lifestyle may not be for you if:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>You’re sentimental</strong> and your memories are tied to things, like furniture and antiques from family.</li>
<li><strong>You value things</strong> over experiences. Would you rather spend $1000 on a new laptop or a trip to Disneyland?</li>
<li><strong>You don’t enjoy or plan to travel.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>These preferences aren’t always clear cut, but they may shed light on what tends to bring you more enjoyment.</p>
<p>If you’re still interested after that disclaimer, next post will focus on more pragmatic tips from my incomplete journey to digital nomadism.</p>
<p>Until then, you’ll find me in an empty closet. <em>I’m trying to make room for the bed…</em></p>
