<p>A couple weeks ago, someone asked me what it meant to be a digital nomad. I rattled off a quick definition: <strong>Digital nomads are people who leverage technology to work from anywhere.</strong> They followed up with: ‚ÄúWhy did <em>you</em> become a digital nomad?‚Äù</p>
<p>I started my usual response: that I loved to travel, that I didn‚Äôt want to be tied down, that stuff isn‚Äôt important to me. But even as I answered, I felt that didn‚Äôt cut it for my current circumstances ‚Äî I haven‚Äôt traveled at all since last year, I have an apartment in Atlanta, and like most apartment tenants I own furniture and a few dishes.</p>
<p>So why am I a digital nomad? What does it mean to be a digital nomad?</p>
<p>When I look at my apartment, <a href="https://blog.yellowscale.com/stuff-that-hasnt-ruined-my-life/">I own very little</a>. The only furniture I own is a desk, mattress and IKEA bookshelf. My entire wardrobe fits in a couple IKEA baskets (super great hack by the way, dressers are overrated). It didn‚Äôt happen overnight: <a href="https://blog.yellowscale.com/your-map-to-mount-nomad/">I‚Äôve been consolidating, selling and giving away for years</a>.</p>
<p>Is owning very little the recipe for being a digital nomad? It certainly seems like a crucial ingredient, but somehow it doesn‚Äôt feel like the hallmark.</p>
<p>I was feeling a bit nostalgic, so I hopped into my journal to do some trip planning. I started outlining how I want to spend a month in Norway, then (finally) see Iceland and do car camping. Perhaps I could see southern New Zealand‚Äôs Alps too.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs when it made sense: the reason I can make outlandish plans and expect to turn them into reality is <em>because</em> I‚Äôm a digital nomad. Owning as little as possible empowers me to drop everything with zero ties or regrets to taint the joys.</p>
<p><strong>Being a digital nomad is about safeguarding your freedom to pursue the lifestyle of your choice with as few impediments as possible, and then pursuing that lifestyle with deliberation and intentionality.</strong></p>
<p>I‚Äôm reading an inspiring article about the experience <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2138841/how-live-out-your-car">living out of a car</a>. I had considered a travel trailer before, but hadn‚Äôt sold myself on the idea of towing my life everywhere I go. Retrofitting an SUV seems like a more reasonable option to start, but the limited space borders on extreme even for me. But my favorite takeaway from the post is this gem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúWhen you don‚Äôt own many things, you don‚Äôt worry about many things.‚Äù<br>
‚ÄîAndy Cochrane</p>
</blockquote>
<p>‚òùÔ∏è That one sentence sums up one of the greatest freedoms of being a digital nomad. You won‚Äôt be on the road 100% of the time (I‚Äôm nowhere near). But no matter where you are, you won‚Äôt have anything stopping you from pursuing your priorities.</p>
<p>So <em>hallo</em> Norway, <em>hall√≥</em> Iceland, and hello New Zealand. There‚Äôs no-thing stopping me.</p>

You‚Äôre not alone. üò© Months or years after a trip, my library is still full of photos with great potential that I can‚Äôt seem to get right. <a href="https://fstoppers.com/education/nine-landscape-photography-techniques-overcome-editors-block-247524">On Fstoppers, we go in-depth on ‚Äúeditor‚Äôs block‚Äù</a> and techniques to get photos out of creative ruts.</p>
<p>Editor‚Äôs block is tough to get past ‚Äî it‚Äôs a form of creative block because post production is one of the most creative parts of the photography workflow. The longer a photo remains in this state, the harder it becomes for us to distance ourselves from the photo to find a new perspective.</p>
<p>So how do you get landscape photos out of post-production purgatory? üî• <strong>Most of the techniques focus on reestablishing objectivity:</strong> after all, we‚Äôre phenomenally good at critiquing another photographer‚Äôs work because we can empathize with an audience who has never seen the photo. Objectivity is not exactly an on/off switch, but there are ways to trick our brains into thinking we‚Äôre editing a new photo!</p>
<p>Several of these techniques are borrowed from traditional drawing media, but my favorite is inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing">annealing</a> in metallurgy: <strong>randomly copy-paste settings from other edited photos!</strong> In blacksmithing, annealing refers to heating up a metal and slowly cooling it to produce a stronger result. The heat and controlled cooling allows the metal atoms to move around freely (at random) before slowly settling into the strongest formation.</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Hill_Climbing_with_Simulated_Annealing.gif" alt="9 Landscape Photography Techniques to Overcome Editor‚Äôs Block"></p>
<p>In photography, we are essentially searching for the best looking edit by modifying curves, contrast and many other sliders. With ‚Äúsimulated annealing,‚Äù you start editing by making completely random jumps to discover possible artistic directions, but over time focus on optimizing the better directions. When you‚Äôre stuck, you just need to make random jumps again. It‚Äôs surprisingly effective in blacksmithing‚Ä¶ and post production!</p>
<p>So if you‚Äôre stuck editing the same photo and can't seem to figure out an edit that works, <a href="https://fstoppers.com/education/nine-landscape-photography-techniques-overcome-editors-block-247524">here are nine powerful techniques to get out of editor's block</a>. ‚ú®</p>

<p>You probably think you‚Äôre exceptionally rational. In fact, you might say you‚Äôre more rational than average. Ironically, that perception itself is a cognitive flaw: the bias blind spot.</p>
<p>So why care about cognitive biases if everyone is affected by them? By identifying them in your own reasoning, <strong>you can advance in your craft faster.</strong> This isn‚Äôt fuzzy mumbo jumbo: cognitive biases have a measurable impact on your mood, productivity and decision making, so countering them leads to intentional, measurable progress in your field.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sunk Cost Fallacy,</strong> ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just make the best of it.‚Äù</li>
<li><strong>Planning Fallacy,</strong> ‚ÄúI‚Äôll improve with time.‚Äù</li>
<li><strong>Impostor Syndrome,</strong> ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a total fraud.‚Äù</li>
<li><strong>Observational Selection Bias,</strong> ‚ÄúEveryone has my camera!‚Äù</li>
<li><strong>Anchoring Effect,</strong> ‚ÄúBut the price is reasonable?‚Äù</li>
</ul>
<p>I‚Äôve personally struggled with most of these cognitive biases <a href="https://blog.yellowscale.com/stuff-is-ruining-your-life/">during the last few years of becoming a digital nomad</a>. At first they mostly related to decluttering, but when I began working remotely full-time, I discovered just how much they affected my work productivity. With some introspection and practice, I boosted my longterm productivity enough that my coworkers and family noticed. Nowadays, <strong>I get 50% more work done in the same amount of time.</strong></p>
<p>‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôll just become a better travel photographer with time and practice.&quot;  True, but you might fall prey to the Planning Fallacy, which leads us to repeat mistakes and disregard prior experience that would otherwise yield actionable insights.</p>
<p>You deserve to get the most out of the time and money you invest in your craft, so check out the entire post on Fstoppers to learn how to <a href="https://fstoppers.com/originals/advance-your-travel-photography-spotting-these-cognitive-biases-240209">spot these biases in your day-to-day thinking and advance your travel photography</a>.</p>

Your US tax return might fund a year off-the-grid."><p>Imagine working remotely from the Alps, living in B&amp;Bs full-time as a location independent consultant. Sound like a dream only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around_the_World_in_Eighty_Days">Phileas Fogg</a> could realize? üá∫üá∏ Uncle Sam may be able to help.</p>
<p>Have you filed your taxes yet? Here‚Äôs something to consider for next year‚Äôs tax return: if you are a full-time traveler, or want to become one, <strong>you can substantially reduce your US tax burden.</strong> It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ an incentive to travel!</p>
<p>So how does tax day work for digital nomads like travel photographers? First, don‚Äôt just skip filing: <strong>as long as you are a US citizen, you must file US taxes.</strong> You definitely don‚Äôt want expensive postcards from Uncle Sam. However, if you‚Äôre outside the US for most of the year, you may be off the hook for income taxes!</p>
<p>The TL;DR version is you can claim <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_earned_income_exclusion">Foreign Earned Income Exclusion</a> on the first $100,000 of your income if you can prove you‚Äôve been outside the US for 330 out of 365 days (Physical Presence Test). However, this won‚Äôt get you out of the ~15% self-employment tax for Social Security and Medicare. To reduce those taxes, you need to work with an expert who can help you set up the appropriate business structure‚Äîoften as a ‚Äú<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_classification_election">foreign disregarded entity</a>.‚Äù</p>
<p>You can usually reduce your state income taxes as well, but it‚Äôs downright tricky to avoid in certain states (looking at you, California), so if you plan to turn digital nomad it is worth establishing residency in another state first.</p>
<p>I am definitely <em>not</em> an accountant and never want to be‚Äîfiling this year‚Äôs 1040 murdered my soul. So don‚Äôt trust or ask for my advice. Instead, here are some fabulous resources on the nitty gritty of expat tax law:</p>

</ul>
<p>If you live outside the US for 330+ days of the year, get in touch with an expert who specializes in expat tax law. When you can potentially save tens of thousands of dollars, it‚Äôs worth investing in a professional who knows what they‚Äôre doing so you don‚Äôt get in trouble with Uncle Sam.</p>
<p>Some back-of-the-hand math suggests I could easily cover the cost of living difference abroad‚Äîplus flights, AirBnBs, car rentals‚Äîwith that money. <em>Happy tax day indeed!</em></p>
<p>My excuses for not traveling full-time are disappearing. üí∏ One year off the grid, anyone?</p>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.magiclantern.fm/">Magic Lantern</a></strong>. It‚Äôs free and replaces a shutter release, intervalometer and more. Just make sure to have an extra SD card <a href="https://blog.yellowscale.com/photo-journal-spirit-falls/">in case it misbehaves</a>.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-Professional-USB-Dual-Slot-Reader/dp/B00WBK03OU/?tag=nybblr08-20">CompactFlash card reader</a></strong>. Cheap readers can corrupt CF cards, so it‚Äôs worth spending a few extra dollars for a reputable one.</li>

<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/03/one-bag-packing-list.jpg" alt="What‚Äôs in My Camera Bag for Landscape Photography?"></p>
<p>There are a few things you <strong>won‚Äôt</strong> find in my photography kit:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Second camera body</strong>. If the worst happens and my camera drowns, I‚Äôll have to expedite a replacement. Meantime, I‚Äôd rather travel light so my gear is less likely to be stolen.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple lenses</strong>. I own a second lens, but travel with just one. It‚Äôs just too painful to swap lenses out in the elements, especially when a single wide-angle lens covers 95% of my landscape portfolio.</li>
<li><strong>Lens cleaning kit</strong>. The polarizing filter pretty much lives on my lens, so I just make due with microfiber cloths.</li>
<li><strong>GPS module</strong>. Instead, I use my iPhone as a GPS logger.</li>
<li><strong>Shutter release or intervalometer</strong>. Thanks, Magic Lantern!</li>
<li><strong>Lighting equipment</strong>. I have flashes and modifiers for shooting portraiture, <a href="https://fstoppers.com/originals/how-fit-your-gear-and-clothes-one-bag-travel-indefinitely-226731">but when traveling I razor focus my shoot genre</a> to landscape photography.</li>
<li><strong>Drone</strong>. Video drones are too big for my carry on and compete with my time shooting landscape photography. Perhaps the next version of the DJI Mavic?</li>
<li><strong>Tools</strong>. TSA frowns on multitools, so all of my equipment must go together and disassemble without allen wrenches.</li>
</ul>
<p>That‚Äôs it! My camera gear lives in the same bag as the rest of my travel entourage‚Äî<a href="https://fstoppers.com/originals/how-fit-your-gear-and-clothes-one-bag-travel-indefinitely-226731">here‚Äôs the entire packing list</a>.</p>

<p>Sadly, I had exhausted the accessible landmarks around Mount Hood and the Columbia River Gorge. My original destination, Bend Oregon, was swamped in snow. North of the gorge, Mount Rainier was locked in snow. I texted home for recommendations for a nearby region that wasn‚Äôt in a second ice age.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI want to see mountains, Gandalf. Lakes and vistas too. Any recommends, hobbits?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúDid you see Spirit Falls, precious?‚Äù</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/34542719710/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/03/spirit-falls-alt.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: Spirit Falls"></a></p>
<p>Just north of the Oregon-Washington border lies one of the truly hidden gems of the Columbia River Gorge. Spirit Falls has no public trail, and until recently the only known trail down the steep gorge crossed illegally into private land.</p>
<p>I drove to the bend in the road described in a hiking forum, but found the shoulder peppered with signs, ‚ÄúNo public access to Spirit Falls.‚Äù Defeated by a sign! I hopped in the car to head back to Oregon, but first decided to do a little more research on the forums.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/03/spirit-falls-gorge.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: Spirit Falls"></p>
<p>A fellow hiker mentioned an alternate trail in the comments section. He described a steep descent which skirts around the property and goes through an area owned by a hiker-friendly company. It was definitely an at-your-own-risk path with some steep muddy spots that my hamstrings sharply protested. But with GPS and careful footing (or kayaking), it was much easier than descriptions of the previous (illegal) path.</p>
<p>I was the only one in the gorge all morning. The trees and pounding mist made it difficult to find a composition my 24‚Äì105mm lens could squeeze in, but Spirit Falls was easily the most idyllic falls in the region. Simply stunning.</p>

<p>I think my camera was also thrilled: it crashed three times.</p>

Trillium Lake was on my bucket list, and according to Google Maps would only be a half mile off the main road.</p>
<p>I made a quick stop by a ranger station just outside Hood River to pick up a ‚Äúsno park‚Äù permit, then made the haul out to Government Camp. The highway was a bit dicey in places, but fabulously inspirational as it wove through the Mount Hood National Forest.</p>
<p>When I pulled into the Trillium Sno Park, I didn‚Äôt take much notice of all the folks with snow shoes and skiing equipment. Word on the street was that the snow had a nice coating of ice on top and would be easy to walk without snow shoes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd the lake is close, it‚Äôs just about a quarter of a mile walk,‚Äù a fellow hiker cheerfully reassured as he pulled his ski equipment out of a 4WD SUV.</p>
<blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/BSXKU9aAZJZ/"></blockquote>
<p>Close to the trailhead, the snow was indeed easy enough to walk on. But after two miles of laboring into steadily soggier snow (mostly downhill), I still hadn‚Äôt reached the lake.</p>
<p>At this point, the snow behaved eerily like quicksand. Every step was succeeded by a fall of three feet; more than once I lost my footing altogether and had trouble lifting myself out of waist deep snow.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/03/snow-signs.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: Mount Hood"></p>
<p>After a few trials and backtracking, I found a path to the lake. Sadly, it was a disappointing view‚Äîto get a proper view of Mount Hood in the background, I would need to hike a couple more miles around the frozen lake.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/03/trillium-lake.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: Mount Hood"></p>
<p>Naive southerner that I was, I wimped out.</p>
<p>Three miles later of drowning in uphill snow, I made it back to the car with zero photos to show for my efforts. My only takeaways were a few iPhone panos and a newfound phobia of snow. I spent the rest of the afternoon in a coffeeshop perusing my photographic spoils.</p>
<p>On the way back to my B&amp;B in Hood River, I passed a small airfield with a fantastically clear view of Mount Hood. With it‚Äôs snow-capped peak, ‚ÄúThe Mountain‚Äù is easily one of the most photogenic mountains in the USA, and commands the horizon from 50 miles away.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/33960400990/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2017/12/185A4102.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: Mount Hood"></a></p>
<p>Till then I had struggled to find an unobscured view of Mount Hood, and ironically one of the clearest was just down the street from my stay. My B&amp;B host wrapped up an eventful day with an invitation to join some guests for dinner and games.</p>
<p>I checked in with my folks to boast of my conquests: seven feet of snow, closed roads and seafood. ‚ÄúYou would‚Äôve been proud of me, today I had smoked grilled salmon.‚Äù</p>

<p>I decided to tack on a week of photography to the end of a business trip in Portland, and made Hood River my home base. The Columbia River Gorge deserves its own journal, but the wet drive from Portland to Hood River can be mostly summed up in six falls, four drenchings and a few mudslides.</p>
<p>I stopped off at a coffeeshop in Hood River overlooking the Columbia River and Oregon‚ÄìWashington border. Quite a romantic setting.</p>
<blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/BSeFqZzA-4x/"></blockquote>
<p>Driving to my AirBnB a few minutes away felt like discovering a cabin‚Äîit was a large, plainly furnished room down a dirt road that‚Äôs not even on Google Maps.</p>
<p>My experience at a nearby old-fashioned gas station wasn‚Äôt as decidedly atmospheric. I hesitated when they asked for my credit card and pumped for me, but I was equally grateful that they washed the windows while I waited. When in Oregon‚Ä¶</p>
<p>On recommendation, I had an exceptional dinner at The Mesquitery. The sides‚Äînot to mention the chicken schnitzel‚Äîwere my favorite meal of the trip. Guessing by the accent, giant portions and pierogi, the owners seemed Polish.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/02/dinner.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: Lost Lake at Mount Hood"></p>
<p>Despite the year‚Äôs unusually heavy snowfall, my host mentioned that the road to Lost Lake was rumored to be accessible. So my first morning in Hood River, I drove through the snow packed forest roads to Lost Lake.</p>
<p>There was a road closure a few miles out.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/02/snow-walls.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: Lost Lake at Mount Hood"></p>
<p>‚ÄúSo don‚Äôt tell anyone‚Ä¶ but I just drove 5 miles past the warning.‚Äù My brother wasn‚Äôt too fazed by my text. I drove within a quarter mile of the lake before hitting solidly iced roads, then hiked the last stretch atop seven feet of snow to this lonely, snowy paradise. Thanks to a solid layer of ice on top, I didn‚Äôt snow pole much‚Äîa circumstance I foolishly took for granted.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/34193853240/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/02/lost-lake.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: Lost Lake at Mount Hood"></a></p>
<p>I‚Äôm rarely reckless, but I blame the fantastic setting: the deep green woods, the overwhelming smell of ferns and a light chill felt like poetry.</p>
<p>I cautiously snapped some panoramas while trying not to sink into underground picnic tables. A tripod was out of the question, but with some blending and stitching I ended up with a 20-shot panorama of Mount Hood.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/38904686934/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/02/mount-hood-over-lost-lake.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: Lost Lake at Mount Hood"></a></p>
<p>I texted my brother again once I made it back to the car.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy heart is going thump right now. All I can say about this morning is: wow. This has been a nearly life changing experience‚ÄîI feel in my element =D‚Äù</p>

<p>The prior night, we drove the long haul from Devonshire to the hills of north Wales and Snowdonia National Park‚Äîa fairly intense in the dark.</p>
<p>I had the car to myself the following day (yay!), so I drove at random through the park. Snowdonia‚Äôs eerily Alpine roads echo the mood of Yosemite and the Scottish Highlands. But like Ireland, conditions and lighting change rapidly.</p>
<blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/BZiswCSgNwi/"></blockquote>
<p>I couldn‚Äôt imagine a better place to build my castle in the air. I can't help but feel Snowdonia is an underrated photographer‚Äôs haven‚Äîand I wouldn‚Äôt mind it staying that way!</p>
<p>About midday I drove to the idyllic South Stack Lighthouse on Holy Island. Despite the time of day, it was a fairly successful first visit and I figured I‚Äôd ‚Äúgotten the shot,‚Äù so I drove back to Caernarfon for some coffee to weather the rain.</p>
<blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/BZgTXEnAAqV/"></blockquote>
<p><em>(Yes, technically this latte was in Sheffield‚ÄîI decided not to snap an insta and look like a dork in every coffeeshop.)</em></p>
<p>Of course, the second visit is <em>always</em> better, so after passing the afternoon in a coffeeshop, I ended up at the lighthouse a second time‚Äîthis time about an hour shy of sunset.</p>
<p>My earlier visit was smallcakes in comparison. Just as golden hour approached, I watched a thick fog roll in. I nearly abandoned the shoot altogether‚Äîit was thick enough to completely obscure the sunset and lighthouse. But still, it was mesmerizing to watch the blanket of fog roll in and out with almost magical rapidity.</p>
<p>The mood was there, even if the lighthouse wasn‚Äôt.</p>
<p>The scene suddenly cleared, and while the lighthouse became visible, a remainder of thick fog clung to the rocks in the foreground. Thankfully my shot was already composed, so I started the 60-second exposure.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/39717789032/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/02/south-stack-lighthouse.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: South Stack Lighthouse in Wales"></a></p>
<p>By the second shot, the lighthouse was completely invisible again.</p>
<p>This was probably the best unexpected shoot of the trip‚ÄîI  figured the thick fog would ruin the shot, so I certainly didn‚Äôt expect to get a <em>better</em> photo than what I already had!</p>
<p>It was wild to observe such rapid changes in the weather, and I couldn‚Äôt help feeling that a leprechaun had followed me from Ireland to resettle in north Wales.</p>
<p>Wise leprechaun.</p>

But in a world crisscrossed by millions of tourists, what is left to explore and savor to ourselves‚Äîsomewhere we won't fight against a crowd of selfie-snapping tourists?</p>
<p>The rising popularity of lifestyles that indulge this yearning‚Äîdigital nomadism, minimalism‚Äîhighlights our desperation for these unsullied havens. These places are not bucket list tourist destinations: they‚Äôre next door, up a mountain or down a snow-covered back road. They can‚Äôt be reached by train, bus or flight: they‚Äôre a car ride, walk and hike away. It‚Äôs not always a comfortable or well-paved route to get there‚Äîexactly what we need to weed out tourists.</p>
<p>Since first stepping across the Atlantic <a href="https://blog.yellowscale.com/19-tips-for-international-travelers-adventurers-edition/">4 years ago</a>, I've found that such havens are usually free and at their best:</p>
<ol>
<li>Out of season</li>
<li>At an unpopular time of day</li>
<li>In uncomfortable weather</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are 10 of my favorite havens across Europe and the US. If you see something you like, I do prints! Just ping me on <a href="https://twitter.com/nybblr">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yellowscale">Facebook</a>.</p>
<h2 id="imanowarbeachengland">I. Man O‚ÄôWar Beach (England)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/24394880678/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2017/12/185A6923.jpg" alt="Wish You [Weren‚Äôt] Here"></a></p>
<p>The Jurassic Coast is one of the most photogenically dense regions of England. Most adventurers head for Durdle Door in Dorset, but despite the door‚Äôs instant appeal, it is surprisingly boring and difficult to shoot a unique angle.</p>
<p>Luckily, the real beauty of this region is just a few steps east: the Man O‚ÄôWar Beach. Unlike Durdle Door which favors sunset, the beach‚Äôs lighting is best just before sunrise. I scoped the area out before the 6am dawn; the fiery morning clouds looked like finger-combed cotton candy.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs great to have dawn to yourself, but it was equally delightful to meet a few dedicated photographers who drove all night from Manchester to arrive in time for the light show!</p>
<h2 id="iigimmelwaldswitzerland">II. Gimmelwald (Switzerland)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/30437504430/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2017/12/185A0574.jpg" alt="Wish You [Weren‚Äôt] Here"></a></p>
<p>Gimmelwald is a tiny Swiss hill town that lies at the foot of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungfrau-Aletsch_protected_area">Jungfrau</a> above Lauterbrunnen. The better known tourist destination of M√ºrren is just 30 minutes away on foot, but lacks the remote charm that Gimmelwald offers.</p>
<p>Accommodations in the area are less than breathtaking, but at night the surrounding mountains and lights throughout the village transform an otherwise commonplace Alpine setting into a magical mountain haven!</p>
<h2 id="iiistrumbleheadlighthousewales">III. Strumble Head Lighthouse (Wales)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/38089576732/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2017/12/185A6611.jpg" alt="Wish You [Weren‚Äôt] Here"></a></p>
<p>After a week in Ireland, we took the south ferry to cross over to Wales and the Pembrokeshire Coast. We loitered about St. Davids for most of the day trying to escape the drizzle (and tourists) by flitting from coffee shop to gift shop before we finally resolved to go shoot Strumble Head Lighthouse.</p>
<p>I felt truly alive when we pulled up to the lighthouse‚Äîa fast moving ceiling of clouds, drizzly fits and idyllic rocks. It was wet work, but I can't recall a time I was more happy to be drenched.</p>
<p>It even compensated for the treacherous night drive back: many of the roads were completely flooded, turning a 30 minute drive into 1.5 hours of blindly backing up hedged country roads and trying to avoid minor roads.</p>
<h2 id="ivgeroldseegermany">IV. Geroldsee (Germany)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/32487513255/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2017/12/185A2716.jpg" alt="Wish You [Weren‚Äôt] Here"></a></p>
<p>Geroldsee is probably one of the better known ‚Äúuntouristy‚Äù spots of the region, thanks to its lake and chalets. On our last day in Germany, we stayed in the nearby town of Farchant.</p>
<p>I was feeling exceptionally lazy due to a fever, so we almost didn't make the 30 minute drive. I'm glad we did! By the time I found the right viewpoint, the sun peeked out to give one last (and my favorite) impression of Bavaria.</p>
<h2 id="vpeitlerkofelitaly">V. Peitlerkofel (Italy)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/32946472550/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2017/12/185A1735.jpg" alt="Wish You [Weren‚Äôt] Here"></a></p>
<p>On our way to Lago di Braies from Santa Magdalena, we passed some cabins at the foot of the Sass de Putia (Peitlerkofel in German) right off the main road. It‚Äôs one of those spots you‚Äôd never find without driving‚Äîbut it characterizes the blend of Italian, Austrian and Swiss culture of the Alpine region.</p>
<h2 id="vilostlakeoregonusa">VI. Lost Lake (Oregon, USA)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/34193853240/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2017/12/185A3980.jpg" alt="Wish You [Weren‚Äôt] Here"></a></p>
<p>Visiting the Pacific Northwest is guaranteed to be an adventure, but in early spring it is doubly so due to the region‚Äôs ‚Äúmicroclimates.‚Äù My first morning in Hood River, I drove through the snow packed forest roads to Lost Lake. There was a road closure a few miles out, but I was able to get within a quarter mile of the lake and hiked the last stretch (atop seven feet of snow) to this lonely, snowy paradise.</p>
<h2 id="viispiritfallswashingtonusa">VII. Spirit Falls (Washington, USA)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/33879529964/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2017/12/185A4126.jpg" alt="Wish You [Weren‚Äôt] Here"></a></p>
<p>Just north of the Oregon-Washington border lies one of the truly hidden gems of the Columbia River Gorge. Spirit Falls has no public trail, and until recently the only known trail crossed illegally into private land.</p>
<p>Don't worry, there's now a legal path thanks to the hiker-friendly business that owns a large chunk of the land, albeit it's definitely an at-your-own-risk path with some steep spots. But with some careful footing (or kayaking), this is easily the most idyllic falls in the region.</p>
<h2 id="viiibrunateitaly">VIII. Brunate (Italy)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/24074457289/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2017/12/185A9224.jpg" alt="Wish You [Weren‚Äôt] Here"></a></p>
<p>On our second day in Como, we took the funicolare to the little hill town of Brunate.</p>
<p>We had trouble finding the funicolare, and just as the sun was getting ready to set, we met a man who had lived on the outskirts of Como his whole life. He was incredibly friendly and walked us down to the station. Thanks to his kindness, we reached the top within 5 minutes of the nautical twilight!</p>
<p>Though the picture doesn't do the landscape justice, this was probably my favorite view from our entire trek through Italy. The little hill towns of Italy hide remarkable beauty!</p>
<h2 id="ixsangimignanoitaly">IX. San Gimignano (Italy)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2017/12/185A9348.jpg" alt="Wish You [Weren‚Äôt] Here"></a></p>
<p>I'm not one for photographing European villages‚ÄîI prefer their envious landscapes‚Äîand usually keep my camera packed up while perusing the shops and gelaterias. But away from the city center you can always find tight, windy roads that characterize the Italian way.</p>
<h2 id="xmounthoodoregonusa">X. Mount Hood (Oregon, USA)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/33960400990/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2017/12/185A4102.jpg" alt="Wish You [Weren‚Äôt] Here"></a></p>
<p>The Pacific Northwest is just so outstanding, it deserves one last shout out. Easily one of the most photogenic mountains in the USA, Mount Hood and its snow-capped peak commands the horizon from 50 miles away.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Mountain‚Äù is probably the first natural landmark I had ever wanted to photograph since purchasing my first DSLR 6 years ago, so it was amazing to spend 6 days in the region. I had trouble getting a clear view the first couple days, but a local airfield in Hood River obliged my camera.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs easy to observe <em>someone else‚Äôs</em> life transformation. When a muffin-top friend disappears for 6 months and comes back trim and buff, the ‚Äúrapid‚Äù transformation belies the difficult steps needed to reproduce the end result. Seeing change isn‚Äôt enough to accomplish it‚Äîyou have to commit to a methodical (and often radical) plan.</p>
<p>In some ways, digital nomadism is like getting in shape: we can easily envy our clutter-free friends and their world expeditions, but achieving a similar situation can be daunting. But even if you aren‚Äôt ready to travel the world, you can start ‚Äúgetting in shape‚Äù today!</p>
<p><a href="https://500px.com/photo/180936001/jungfrau-over-gimmelwald-by-jonathan-martin"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/12/185A0574.jpg" alt="Becoming a Digital Nomad starts today, not tomorrow."></a></p>
<h2 id="1adoptthemindset">1. Adopt the mindset.</h2>
<p>The nomadic mindset is independent of where you live. If you can feel like you aren't living out of a suitcase when you travel, you can eventually embrace a similar lifestyle at home.</p>
<p>Hipsters try to be different for the sake of being different. But fads change, so before long term lifestyle changes begin to pay off, they may cease to be trendy. Consequently, digital nomadism is not a ‚Äúhipster‚Äù thing; like getting in shape, worthwhile lifestyle changes take time. So research what you‚Äôre in for, then work towards the goal. <em>Don‚Äôt just be different for the sake of it.</em></p>
<p>That said, be prepared to diverge from cultural norms. Most people have only sampled a few dots within 30 degrees of longitude, so the majority of our conceptions come from a tiny sliver of the 360 degree globe.</p>
<p>Some people become nomads expecting travel to bring them the happiness that possessions cannot. But travel can be like work: it may bring you enjoyment, pleasure and occupation, <em>but not contentment.</em> If you aren‚Äôt content now, don‚Äôt expect to be content for long as a digital nomad.</p>
<h2 id="2recognizecognitivebiases">2. Recognize cognitive biases.</h2>
<p>I grew up in the South, so getting in shape is hard if you don‚Äôt first recognize an ‚Äúeat everything on your plate‚Äù mentality and consciously fight it.</p>
<p>Ownership has its own assortment of these mentalities, but before you can break them, you have to recognize generational habits and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias">cognitive biases</a>.</p>
<p><strong>‚Äú<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs">Sunk cost</a>‚Äù</strong> is a widespread bias that dramatically affects decision making, especially when paired with a ‚Äúwaste not, want not‚Äù attitude. Say you purchased an expensive coffee table a year ago, but now it just doesn‚Äôt work with the decor. The rational decision would be to sell or give the item away, but as ‚Äúyou might need it someday‚Äù it would be a waste to toss something you paid so much money for, so you might opt to store it.</p>
<p>But ownership also has a cost: you might inconvenience the garage (and your toes) for years before finally tossing the table, or rack up professional mover fees. This is an example of a <strong>sunk cost</strong>‚Äîwhether you keep it or toss it, you have already paid for the table and are unlikely to recover the costs. So the feeling of ‚Äúlosing money‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt affect your decision‚Äîsometimes getting rid of stuff pays for itself in emotional well-being! Don‚Äôt add to your losses by punishing yourself for costs you can‚Äôt recoup.</p>
<p>The <strong>‚Äú<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well_travelled_road_effect">Well travelled road effect</a>‚Äù</strong> is the tendency to perceive familiar habits (like driving routes) as faster or more effective than alternate options, despite hard numbers to the contrary. It‚Äôs the same reason we tend to resist learning new things as we age. ‚ÄúYour way‚Äù is always better than Google Maps because it‚Äôs the route you‚Äôve always taken, but what new discoveries are you forfeiting? Make an effort to be uncomfortable, and in time you may find yourself comfortable with discomfort.</p>
<h2 id="3getcomfortablewithless">3. Get comfortable with less.</h2>
<p>Your comforts reflect your deepest fears.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúThe more comforts you have, the more your comforts have you.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The American Dream is a shmorgishborg of ‚Äúindispensable‚Äù comforts: hot water, air conditioning, private transportation and laundry facilities. But the most transformative adventures don‚Äôt always happen when there‚Äôs a hot shower nearby.</p>
<p>Comfort goes beyond hygienic conveniences: are you uncomfortable working on the go without a dedicated keyboard, mouse or monitor? A checked bag? If your productivity is directly tethered to a WiFi connection, it can be difficult to work remotely. With <a href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/">key remappers</a>, careful packing and good offline tooling you might find that you were unnecessarily tied down by conveniences that only prevented you from learning better workflows.</p>
<p>When you need less to be comfortable, you are less likely to forget something.</p>
<h2 id="4tightenupbordersecurity">4. Tighten up border security.</h2>
<p>Immigrant clutter should have a rough time getting through customs to your home. Do not become a sanctuary for well-meaning but misplaced things.</p>
<p>Try the ‚Äú1 in, 2 out rule.‚Äù Whenever you make a purchase, donate what it replaces and ditch one other thing. Naturally, you‚Äôll start to bias your purchasing decisions towards things that take the place of multiple things.</p>
<p>‚ÄúClutter‚Äù includes email and snail mail. When you receive either, do your wallet a favor and unsubscribe immediately. Magazines and email campaigns are designed not only to clutter inboxes, but to tantalize your materialistic yearnings.</p>
<h2 id="5deportexistingclutter">5. Deport existing clutter.</h2>
<p>Preventing inbound clutter is straightforward, but the real challenge is removing the decades of junk you already own. This can take years, but with the right mindset it can become second nature and inform your buying habits.</p>
<p>If you are hesitant to declutter because you will be moving to a larger house, consider that if you don‚Äôt have enough room for your things now, <em>you never will.</em> Humans are bad at spatial estimation, so overflowing closets in a tiny apartment are a mere foreshadowing of the unholy rubbish that will consume your future 3-story house.</p>
<p>The safest category to start with is clothing: if you toss half your wardrobe, you‚Äôre unlikely to upset your spouse. Moreover, you can quickly cultivate the virtue of indifference with just a few cleanings. Here‚Äôs the decision tree:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>When did I last wear this?</strong> Specific dates are your pal in spring cleanings. It you haven‚Äôt worn it in 12 months, no questions asked. <strong>Donate it.</strong> Otherwise‚Ä¶</li>
<li><strong>Will I need this for a special occasion?</strong> This is a deceptive question: if the answer is ‚Äúno,‚Äù that‚Äôs easy confirmation, but it‚Äôs usually ‚Äúyes‚Äù even if you actually won‚Äôt ever wear it. We forget that life is not organized like our clothes rack. <strong>Donate it.</strong> Otherwise‚Ä¶</li>
<li><strong>Is there another article I would always prefer wearing over this?</strong> Second-rate multiples rarely get worn, and by the time they are called for your tastes will have changed. <strong>Donate it.</strong></li>
<li>Otherwise, keep it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furniture is difficult to cull. The easiest cure is prevention: focus on creating a modest, well-rounded ensemble. So instead of purchasing 3 bookshelves to fill up a big room, invest in 1 bookshelf, 1 couch, 1 rug, etc. An assortment of pieces can adapt to different spaces more readily than a trio of duplicates. If any item unfairly infringes on the negative space, store the offending article; a well-designed room does not need excess furniture to feel ‚Äúfinished.‚Äù If it is uncalled for after a few months, it‚Äôs time to part ways. This is also a good time to bias towards furniture you can easily move with a friend‚Äôs help.</p>
<h2 id="6virtuesofremainingcitizens">6. Virtues of remaining citizens.</h2>
<p>After a couple years of decluttering and curbing buying habits, your remaining possessions will hopefully exhibit exemplary virtues.</p>
<h3 id="spontaneity">Spontaneity</h3>
<p>The best things happen <s>when you‚Äôre dancing</s> when you can embrace spontaneity. When an unexpected trip means adventure instead of inconvenience, digital nomadism begins to pay off. Thus, it‚Äôs important to choose equipment that frees you to travel.</p>
<p>Could you pack for a couple weeks out of the country in 15 minutes? It‚Äôs a daunting benchmark, but you can prepare for international trips by streamlining coffee stops and overnight visits. For myself, that meant consolidating my photography equipment and wardrobe into a compact kit. For my mom, it meant switching from glasses to contacts and replacing two purses with a money belt. For artists, it could mean familiarizing yourself with digital art programs like <a href="http://procreate.si/">Procreate</a> to replace an inconvenient gaggle of art mediums.</p>
<p>With daytrips as a way to gauge yourself, you can decide what you absolutely need at all times to enjoy spontaneous adventures.</p>
<h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h3>
<p>Your remaining possessions and records aren‚Äôt much use if you can‚Äôt access them when you need them.</p>
<p>Start by digitizing everything‚Äîideally, the only paper you own should be green and issued by the Federal Reserve. I had enough stacks of paperwork and sheet music to cover half my bedroom, but it was well worth a few days of scanning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sheet music</li>
<li>Bank statements</li>
<li>Tax forms</li>
<li>Sketches</li>
</ul>
<p>With a good backup plan (more on that later), digital copies are better than reams of paper! Image Capture and <a href="https://readdle.com/products/scannerpro">Scanner Pro</a> are great for scanning documents.</p>
<p>Now with everything digitized and backed up, it needs to be accessible from anywhere. You can rely on web services like Dropbox and Gmail, but don‚Äôt forget that you may not always have an Internet connection. For sensitive documents, <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> is worth its price tag when paired with Dropbox for syncing; moreover, the free 1Password mobile app stores a copy of your documents so you can access them offline.</p>
<p>Is your phone loaded with important text messages, like directions or addresses, that you wouldn‚Äôt be able to access in a pinch? Travel reservations should be backed up and easily accessible offline. I use the <a href="https://www.tripit.com/">TripIt</a> app to track all of my travel reservations, but sometimes the app doesn‚Äôt pick up all the details I may need (like barcodes or check-in instructions), so <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> and iBooks are a great last resort.</p>
<h3 id="replaceability">Replaceability</h3>
<p>As a frequent traveler, it is inevitable something important will be damaged or stolen. Losing a phone or laptop is a very real concern for those who create their life‚Äôs work on a fragile arrangement of silicon and plastic. How much data would be lost? How long would it take to set up a brand new device and get it work ready?</p>
<p>The moment of doom is not a great time to discover just what money <em>can‚Äôt</em> buy. Don‚Äôt put yourself in a position where your life would end in cardiac arrest if any of your equipment croaked.</p>
<p>For many with the flexibility of a nomadic lifestyle, data is your most valuable possession. Protect it with the <strong><a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/">3-2-1 backup strategy</a>:</strong> create 3 independent backups with 2 external hard drives and an online service like <a href="https://www.crashplan.com/">CrashPlan</a> for your 3rd backup.</p>
<p>When swapping out equipment becomes a non-event, you‚Äôve achieved Replaceability. After 3 laptops and 7 clean reinstalls of macOS, my personal configuration takes little time to replicate thanks to <a href="https://github.com/nybblr/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> and a <a href="https://gist.github.com/nybblr/0bb105c7b1eba4c54da5">macOS configuration script</a>.</p>

<h2 id="yourturn">Your turn!</h2>
<p>The nomadic lifestyle eliminates worry while enabling you to take advantage of life‚Äôs unforeseeable opportunities, and it‚Äôs a mindset that you can adopt now! So don‚Äôt wait until you decide you‚Äôre ready to travel‚Äîprepare for it now, and you may find it to be a lifestyle that befits you even at home.</p>
<p>Get comfortable with less, eliminate sources of inbound clutter and attach a cost to existing items. Your reward for a well-culled ‚Äústuff life‚Äù is a quality portfolio that is accessible anywhere, easy to replace and friendly to spontaneity.</p>
