Trillium Lake was on my bucket list, and according to Google Maps would only be a half mile off the main road.</p>
<p>I made a quick stop by a ranger station just outside Hood River to pick up a “sno park” permit, then made the haul out to Government Camp. The highway was a bit dicey in places, but fabulously inspirational as it wove through the Mount Hood National Forest.</p>
<p>When I pulled into the Trillium Sno Park, I didn’t take much notice of all the folks with snow shoes and skiing equipment. Word on the street was that the snow had a nice coating of ice on top and would be easy to walk without snow shoes.</p>
<p>“And the lake is close, it’s just about a quarter of a mile walk,” a fellow hiker cheerfully reassured as he pulled his ski equipment out of a 4WD SUV.</p>
<blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/BSXKU9aAZJZ/"></blockquote>
<p>Close to the trailhead, the snow was indeed easy enough to walk on. But after two miles of laboring into steadily soggier snow (mostly downhill), I still hadn’t reached the lake.</p>
<p>At this point, the snow behaved eerily like quicksand. Every step was succeeded by a fall of three feet; more than once I lost my footing altogether and had trouble lifting myself out of waist deep snow.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/03/snow-signs.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: Mount Hood"></p>
<p>After a few trials and backtracking, I found a path to the lake. Sadly, it was a disappointing view—to get a proper view of Mount Hood in the background, I would need to hike a couple more miles around the frozen lake.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/03/trillium-lake.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: Mount Hood"></p>
<p>Naive southerner that I was, I wimped out.</p>
<p>Three miles later of drowning in uphill snow, I made it back to the car with zero photos to show for my efforts. My only takeaways were a few iPhone panos and a newfound phobia of snow. I spent the rest of the afternoon in a coffeeshop perusing my photographic spoils.</p>
<p>On the way back to my B&amp;B in Hood River, I passed a small airfield with a fantastically clear view of Mount Hood. With it’s snow-capped peak, “The Mountain” is easily one of the most photogenic mountains in the USA, and commands the horizon from 50 miles away.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/33960400990/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2017/12/185A4102.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: Mount Hood"></a></p>
<p>Till then I had struggled to find an unobscured view of Mount Hood, and ironically one of the clearest was just down the street from my stay. My B&amp;B host wrapped up an eventful day with an invitation to join some guests for dinner and games.</p>
<p>I checked in with my folks to boast of my conquests: seven feet of snow, closed roads and seafood. “You would’ve been proud of me, today I had smoked grilled salmon.”</p>

<p>As a photographer, becoming a digital nomad empowers you to see the world as a local, not as a tourist. It’s helped me take better photos, boosted my creativity, and given me more time to dedicate to photography outside my day job.</p>
<p><strong>You can start living the digital nomad lifestyle today,</strong> long before you ever sell your house or hit the road.</p>

<p>I decided to tack on a week of photography to the end of a business trip in Portland, and made Hood River my home base. The Columbia River Gorge deserves its own journal, but the wet drive from Portland to Hood River can be mostly summed up in six falls, four drenchings and a few mudslides.</p>
<p>I stopped off at a coffeeshop in Hood River overlooking the Columbia River and Oregon–Washington border. Quite a romantic setting.</p>
<blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/BSeFqZzA-4x/"></blockquote>
<p>Driving to my AirBnB a few minutes away felt like discovering a cabin—it was a large, plainly furnished room down a dirt road that’s not even on Google Maps.</p>
<p>My experience at a nearby old-fashioned gas station wasn’t as decidedly atmospheric. I hesitated when they asked for my credit card and pumped for me, but I was equally grateful that they washed the windows while I waited. When in Oregon…</p>
<p>On recommendation, I had an exceptional dinner at The Mesquitery. The sides—not to mention the chicken schnitzel—were my favorite meal of the trip. Guessing by the accent, giant portions and pierogi, the owners seemed Polish.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/02/dinner.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: Lost Lake at Mount Hood"></p>
<p>Despite the year’s unusually heavy snowfall, my host mentioned that the road to Lost Lake was rumored to be accessible. So my first morning in Hood River, I drove through the snow packed forest roads to Lost Lake.</p>
<p>There was a road closure a few miles out.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/02/snow-walls.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: Lost Lake at Mount Hood"></p>
<p>“So don’t tell anyone… but I just drove 5 miles past the warning.” My brother wasn’t too fazed by my text. I drove within a quarter mile of the lake before hitting solidly iced roads, then hiked the last stretch atop seven feet of snow to this lonely, snowy paradise. Thanks to a solid layer of ice on top, I didn’t snow pole much—a circumstance I foolishly took for granted.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/34193853240/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/02/lost-lake.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: Lost Lake at Mount Hood"></a></p>
<p>I’m rarely reckless, but I blame the fantastic setting: the deep green woods, the overwhelming smell of ferns and a light chill felt like poetry.</p>
<p>I cautiously snapped some panoramas while trying not to sink into underground picnic tables. A tripod was out of the question, but with some blending and stitching I ended up with a 20-shot panorama of Mount Hood.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/38904686934/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/02/mount-hood-over-lost-lake.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: Lost Lake at Mount Hood"></a></p>
<p>I texted my brother again once I made it back to the car.</p>
<p>“My heart is going thump right now. All I can say about this morning is: wow. This has been a nearly life changing experience—I feel in my element =D”</p>

<p>The prior night, we drove the long haul from Devonshire to the hills of north Wales and Snowdonia National Park—a fairly intense in the dark.</p>
<p>I had the car to myself the following day (yay!), so I drove at random through the park. Snowdonia’s eerily Alpine roads echo the mood of Yosemite and the Scottish Highlands. But like Ireland, conditions and lighting change rapidly.</p>
<blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/BZiswCSgNwi/"></blockquote>
<p>I couldn’t imagine a better place to build my castle in the air. I can't help but feel Snowdonia is an underrated photographer’s haven—and I wouldn’t mind it staying that way!</p>
<p>About midday I drove to the idyllic South Stack Lighthouse on Holy Island. Despite the time of day, it was a fairly successful first visit and I figured I’d “gotten the shot,” so I drove back to Caernarfon for some coffee to weather the rain.</p>
<blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/BZgTXEnAAqV/"></blockquote>
<p><em>(Yes, technically this latte was in Sheffield—I decided not to snap an insta and look like a dork in every coffeeshop.)</em></p>
<p>Of course, the second visit is <em>always</em> better, so after passing the afternoon in a coffeeshop, I ended up at the lighthouse a second time—this time about an hour shy of sunset.</p>
<p>My earlier visit was smallcakes in comparison. Just as golden hour approached, I watched a thick fog roll in. I nearly abandoned the shoot altogether—it was thick enough to completely obscure the sunset and lighthouse. But still, it was mesmerizing to watch the blanket of fog roll in and out with almost magical rapidity.</p>
<p>The mood was there, even if the lighthouse wasn’t.</p>
<p>The scene suddenly cleared, and while the lighthouse became visible, a remainder of thick fog clung to the rocks in the foreground. Thankfully my shot was already composed, so I started the 60-second exposure.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/39717789032/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/02/south-stack-lighthouse.jpg" alt="Photo Journal: South Stack Lighthouse in Wales"></a></p>
<p>By the second shot, the lighthouse was completely invisible again.</p>
<p>This was probably the best unexpected shoot of the trip—I  figured the thick fog would ruin the shot, so I certainly didn’t expect to get a <em>better</em> photo than what I already had!</p>
<p>It was wild to observe such rapid changes in the weather, and I couldn’t help feeling that a leprechaun had followed me from Ireland to resettle in north Wales.</p>
<p>Wise leprechaun.</p>

But in a world crisscrossed by millions of tourists, what is left to explore and savor to ourselves—somewhere we won't fight against a crowd of selfie-snapping tourists?</p>
<p>The rising popularity of lifestyles that indulge this yearning—digital nomadism, minimalism—highlights our desperation for these unsullied havens. These places are not bucket list tourist destinations: they’re next door, up a mountain or down a snow-covered back road. They can’t be reached by train, bus or flight: they’re a car ride, walk and hike away. It’s not always a comfortable or well-paved route to get there—exactly what we need to weed out tourists.</p>
<p>Since first stepping across the Atlantic <a href="https://blog.yellowscale.com/19-tips-for-international-travelers-adventurers-edition/">4 years ago</a>, I've found that such havens are usually free and at their best:</p>
<ol>
<li>Out of season</li>
<li>At an unpopular time of day</li>
<li>In uncomfortable weather</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are 10 of my favorite havens across Europe and the US. If you see something you like, I do prints! Just ping me on <a href="https://twitter.com/nybblr">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yellowscale">Facebook</a>.</p>
<h2 id="imanowarbeachengland">I. Man O’War Beach (England)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/24394880678/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2017/12/185A6923.jpg" alt="Wish You [Weren’t] Here"></a></p>
<p>The Jurassic Coast is one of the most photogenically dense regions of England. Most adventurers head for Durdle Door in Dorset, but despite the door’s instant appeal, it is surprisingly boring and difficult to shoot a unique angle.</p>
<p>Luckily, the real beauty of this region is just a few steps east: the Man O’War Beach. Unlike Durdle Door which favors sunset, the beach’s lighting is best just before sunrise. I scoped the area out before the 6am dawn; the fiery morning clouds looked like finger-combed cotton candy.</p>
<p>It’s great to have dawn to yourself, but it was equally delightful to meet a few dedicated photographers who drove all night from Manchester to arrive in time for the light show!</p>
<h2 id="iigimmelwaldswitzerland">II. Gimmelwald (Switzerland)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/30437504430/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2017/12/185A0574.jpg" alt="Wish You [Weren’t] Here"></a></p>
<p>Gimmelwald is a tiny Swiss hill town that lies at the foot of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungfrau-Aletsch_protected_area">Jungfrau</a> above Lauterbrunnen. The better known tourist destination of Mürren is just 30 minutes away on foot, but lacks the remote charm that Gimmelwald offers.</p>
<p>Accommodations in the area are less than breathtaking, but at night the surrounding mountains and lights throughout the village transform an otherwise commonplace Alpine setting into a magical mountain haven!</p>
<h2 id="iiistrumbleheadlighthousewales">III. Strumble Head Lighthouse (Wales)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/38089576732/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2017/12/185A6611.jpg" alt="Wish You [Weren’t] Here"></a></p>
<p>After a week in Ireland, we took the south ferry to cross over to Wales and the Pembrokeshire Coast. We loitered about St. Davids for most of the day trying to escape the drizzle (and tourists) by flitting from coffee shop to gift shop before we finally resolved to go shoot Strumble Head Lighthouse.</p>
<p>I felt truly alive when we pulled up to the lighthouse—a fast moving ceiling of clouds, drizzly fits and idyllic rocks. It was wet work, but I can't recall a time I was more happy to be drenched.</p>
<p>It even compensated for the treacherous night drive back: many of the roads were completely flooded, turning a 30 minute drive into 1.5 hours of blindly backing up hedged country roads and trying to avoid minor roads.</p>
<h2 id="ivgeroldseegermany">IV. Geroldsee (Germany)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/32487513255/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2017/12/185A2716.jpg" alt="Wish You [Weren’t] Here"></a></p>
<p>Geroldsee is probably one of the better known “untouristy” spots of the region, thanks to its lake and chalets. On our last day in Germany, we stayed in the nearby town of Farchant.</p>
<p>I was feeling exceptionally lazy due to a fever, so we almost didn't make the 30 minute drive. I'm glad we did! By the time I found the right viewpoint, the sun peeked out to give one last (and my favorite) impression of Bavaria.</p>
<h2 id="vpeitlerkofelitaly">V. Peitlerkofel (Italy)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/32946472550/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2017/12/185A1735.jpg" alt="Wish You [Weren’t] Here"></a></p>
<p>On our way to Lago di Braies from Santa Magdalena, we passed some cabins at the foot of the Sass de Putia (Peitlerkofel in German) right off the main road. It’s one of those spots you’d never find without driving—but it characterizes the blend of Italian, Austrian and Swiss culture of the Alpine region.</p>
<h2 id="vilostlakeoregonusa">VI. Lost Lake (Oregon, USA)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/34193853240/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2017/12/185A3980.jpg" alt="Wish You [Weren’t] Here"></a></p>
<p>Visiting the Pacific Northwest is guaranteed to be an adventure, but in early spring it is doubly so due to the region’s “microclimates.” My first morning in Hood River, I drove through the snow packed forest roads to Lost Lake. There was a road closure a few miles out, but I was able to get within a quarter mile of the lake and hiked the last stretch (atop seven feet of snow) to this lonely, snowy paradise.</p>
<h2 id="viispiritfallswashingtonusa">VII. Spirit Falls (Washington, USA)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/33879529964/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2017/12/185A4126.jpg" alt="Wish You [Weren’t] Here"></a></p>
<p>Just north of the Oregon-Washington border lies one of the truly hidden gems of the Columbia River Gorge. Spirit Falls has no public trail, and until recently the only known trail crossed illegally into private land.</p>
<p>Don't worry, there's now a legal path thanks to the hiker-friendly business that owns a large chunk of the land, albeit it's definitely an at-your-own-risk path with some steep spots. But with some careful footing (or kayaking), this is easily the most idyllic falls in the region.</p>
<h2 id="viiibrunateitaly">VIII. Brunate (Italy)</h2>

<p>On our second day in Como, we took the funicolare to the little hill town of Brunate.</p>
<p>We had trouble finding the funicolare, and just as the sun was getting ready to set, we met a man who had lived on the outskirts of Como his whole life. He was incredibly friendly and walked us down to the station. Thanks to his kindness, we reached the top within 5 minutes of the nautical twilight!</p>
<p>Though the picture doesn't do the landscape justice, this was probably my favorite view from our entire trek through Italy. The little hill towns of Italy hide remarkable beauty!</p>

<p>I'm not one for photographing European villages—I prefer their envious landscapes—and usually keep my camera packed up while perusing the shops and gelaterias. But away from the city center you can always find tight, windy roads that characterize the Italian way.</p>
<h2 id="xmounthoodoregonusa">X. Mount Hood (Oregon, USA)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/33960400990/"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2017/12/185A4102.jpg" alt="Wish You [Weren’t] Here"></a></p>
<p>The Pacific Northwest is just so outstanding, it deserves one last shout out. Easily one of the most photogenic mountains in the USA, Mount Hood and its snow-capped peak commands the horizon from 50 miles away.</p>
<p>“The Mountain” is probably the first natural landmark I had ever wanted to photograph since purchasing my first DSLR 6 years ago, so it was amazing to spend 6 days in the region. I had trouble getting a clear view the first couple days, but a local airfield in Hood River obliged my camera.</p>

<p>It’s easy to observe <em>someone else’s</em> life transformation. When a muffin-top friend disappears for 6 months and comes back trim and buff, the “rapid” transformation belies the difficult steps needed to reproduce the end result. Seeing change isn’t enough to accomplish it—you have to commit to a methodical (and often radical) plan.</p>
<p>In some ways, digital nomadism is like getting in shape: we can easily envy our clutter-free friends and their world expeditions, but achieving a similar situation can be daunting. But even if you aren’t ready to travel the world, you can start “getting in shape” today!</p>
<p><a href="https://500px.com/photo/180936001/jungfrau-over-gimmelwald-by-jonathan-martin"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/12/185A0574.jpg" alt="Your map to Mount Nomad."></a></p>
<h2 id="1adoptthemindset">1. Adopt the mindset.</h2>
<p>The nomadic mindset is independent of where you live. If you can feel like you aren't living out of a suitcase when you travel, you can eventually embrace a similar lifestyle at home.</p>
<p>Hipsters try to be different for the sake of being different. But fads change, so before long term lifestyle changes begin to pay off, they may cease to be trendy. Consequently, digital nomadism is not a “hipster” thing; like getting in shape, worthwhile lifestyle changes take time. So research what you’re in for, then work towards the goal. <em>Don’t just be different for the sake of it.</em></p>
<p>That said, be prepared to diverge from cultural norms. Most people have only sampled a few dots within 30 degrees of longitude, so the majority of our conceptions come from a tiny sliver of the 360 degree globe.</p>
<p>Some people become nomads expecting travel to bring them the happiness that possessions cannot. But travel can be like work: it may bring you enjoyment, pleasure and occupation, <em>but not contentment.</em> If you aren’t content now, don’t expect to be content for long as a digital nomad.</p>
<h2 id="2recognizecognitivebiases">2. Recognize cognitive biases.</h2>
<p>I grew up in the South, so getting in shape is hard if you don’t first recognize an “eat everything on your plate” mentality and consciously fight it.</p>
<p>Ownership has its own assortment of these mentalities, but before you can break them, you have to recognize generational habits and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias">cognitive biases</a>.</p>
<p><strong>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs">Sunk cost</a>”</strong> is a widespread bias that dramatically affects decision making, especially when paired with a “waste not, want not” attitude. Say you purchased an expensive coffee table a year ago, but now it just doesn’t work with the decor. The rational decision would be to sell or give the item away, but as “you might need it someday” it would be a waste to toss something you paid so much money for, so you might opt to store it.</p>
<p>But ownership also has a cost: you might inconvenience the garage (and your toes) for years before finally tossing the table, or rack up professional mover fees. This is an example of a <strong>sunk cost</strong>—whether you keep it or toss it, you have already paid for the table and are unlikely to recover the costs. So the feeling of “losing money” shouldn’t affect your decision—sometimes getting rid of stuff pays for itself in emotional well-being! Don’t add to your losses by punishing yourself for costs you can’t recoup.</p>
<p>The <strong>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well_travelled_road_effect">Well travelled road effect</a>”</strong> is the tendency to perceive familiar habits (like driving routes) as faster or more effective than alternate options, despite hard numbers to the contrary. It’s the same reason we tend to resist learning new things as we age. “Your way” is always better than Google Maps because it’s the route you’ve always taken, but what new discoveries are you forfeiting? Make an effort to be uncomfortable, and in time you may find yourself comfortable with discomfort.</p>
<h2 id="3getcomfortablewithless">3. Get comfortable with less.</h2>
<p>Your comforts reflect your deepest fears.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The more comforts you have, the more your comforts have you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The American Dream is a shmorgishborg of “indispensable” comforts: hot water, air conditioning, private transportation and laundry facilities. But the most transformative adventures don’t always happen when there’s a hot shower nearby.</p>
<p>Comfort goes beyond hygienic conveniences: are you uncomfortable working on the go without a dedicated keyboard, mouse or monitor? A checked bag? If your productivity is directly tethered to a WiFi connection, it can be difficult to work remotely. With <a href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/">key remappers</a>, careful packing and good offline tooling you might find that you were unnecessarily tied down by conveniences that only prevented you from learning better workflows.</p>
<p>When you need less to be comfortable, you are less likely to forget something.</p>
<h2 id="4tightenupbordersecurity">4. Tighten up border security.</h2>
<p>Immigrant clutter should have a rough time getting through customs to your home. Do not become a sanctuary for well-meaning but misplaced things.</p>
<p>Try the “1 in, 2 out rule.” Whenever you make a purchase, donate what it replaces and ditch one other thing. Naturally, you’ll start to bias your purchasing decisions towards things that take the place of multiple things.</p>
<p>“Clutter” includes email and snail mail. When you receive either, do your wallet a favor and unsubscribe immediately. Magazines and email campaigns are designed not only to clutter inboxes, but to tantalize your materialistic yearnings.</p>
<h2 id="5deportexistingclutter">5. Deport existing clutter.</h2>
<p>Preventing inbound clutter is straightforward, but the real challenge is removing the decades of junk you already own. This can take years, but with the right mindset it can become second nature and inform your buying habits.</p>
<p>If you are hesitant to declutter because you will be moving to a larger house, consider that if you don’t have enough room for your things now, <em>you never will.</em> Humans are bad at spatial estimation, so overflowing closets in a tiny apartment are a mere foreshadowing of the unholy rubbish that will consume your future 3-story house.</p>
<p>The safest category to start with is clothing: if you toss half your wardrobe, you’re unlikely to upset your spouse. Moreover, you can quickly cultivate the virtue of indifference with just a few cleanings. Here’s the decision tree:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>When did I last wear this?</strong> Specific dates are your pal in spring cleanings. It you haven’t worn it in 12 months, no questions asked. <strong>Donate it.</strong> Otherwise…</li>
<li><strong>Will I need this for a special occasion?</strong> This is a deceptive question: if the answer is “no,” that’s easy confirmation, but it’s usually “yes” even if you actually won’t ever wear it. We forget that life is not organized like our clothes rack. <strong>Donate it.</strong> Otherwise…</li>
<li><strong>Is there another article I would always prefer wearing over this?</strong> Second-rate multiples rarely get worn, and by the time they are called for your tastes will have changed. <strong>Donate it.</strong></li>
<li>Otherwise, keep it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furniture is difficult to cull. The easiest cure is prevention: focus on creating a modest, well-rounded ensemble. So instead of purchasing 3 bookshelves to fill up a big room, invest in 1 bookshelf, 1 couch, 1 rug, etc. An assortment of pieces can adapt to different spaces more readily than a trio of duplicates. If any item unfairly infringes on the negative space, store the offending article; a well-designed room does not need excess furniture to feel “finished.” If it is uncalled for after a few months, it’s time to part ways. This is also a good time to bias towards furniture you can easily move with a friend’s help.</p>
<h2 id="6virtuesofremainingcitizens">6. Virtues of remaining citizens.</h2>
<p>After a couple years of decluttering and curbing buying habits, your remaining possessions will hopefully exhibit exemplary virtues.</p>
<h3 id="spontaneity">Spontaneity</h3>
<p>The best things happen <s>when you’re dancing</s> when you can embrace spontaneity. When an unexpected trip means adventure instead of inconvenience, digital nomadism begins to pay off. Thus, it’s important to choose equipment that frees you to travel.</p>
<p>Could you pack for a couple weeks out of the country in 15 minutes? It’s a daunting benchmark, but you can prepare for international trips by streamlining coffee stops and overnight visits. For myself, that meant consolidating my photography equipment and wardrobe into a compact kit. For my mom, it meant switching from glasses to contacts and replacing two purses with a money belt. For artists, it could mean familiarizing yourself with digital art programs like <a href="http://procreate.si/">Procreate</a> to replace an inconvenient gaggle of art mediums.</p>
<p>With daytrips as a way to gauge yourself, you can decide what you absolutely need at all times to enjoy spontaneous adventures.</p>
<h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h3>
<p>Your remaining possessions and records aren’t much use if you can’t access them when you need them.</p>
<p>Start by digitizing everything—ideally, the only paper you own should be green and issued by the Federal Reserve. I had enough stacks of paperwork and sheet music to cover half my bedroom, but it was well worth a few days of scanning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sheet music</li>
<li>Bank statements</li>
<li>Tax forms</li>
<li>Sketches</li>
</ul>
<p>With a good backup plan (more on that later), digital copies are better than reams of paper! Image Capture and <a href="https://readdle.com/products/scannerpro">Scanner Pro</a> are great for scanning documents.</p>
<p>Now with everything digitized and backed up, it needs to be accessible from anywhere. You can rely on web services like Dropbox and Gmail, but don’t forget that you may not always have an Internet connection. For sensitive documents, <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> is worth its price tag when paired with Dropbox for syncing; moreover, the free 1Password mobile app stores a copy of your documents so you can access them offline.</p>
<p>Is your phone loaded with important text messages, like directions or addresses, that you wouldn’t be able to access in a pinch? Travel reservations should be backed up and easily accessible offline. I use the <a href="https://www.tripit.com/">TripIt</a> app to track all of my travel reservations, but sometimes the app doesn’t pick up all the details I may need (like barcodes or check-in instructions), so <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> and iBooks are a great last resort.</p>
<h3 id="replaceability">Replaceability</h3>
<p>As a frequent traveler, it is inevitable something important will be damaged or stolen. Losing a phone or laptop is a very real concern for those who create their life’s work on a fragile arrangement of silicon and plastic. How much data would be lost? How long would it take to set up a brand new device and get it work ready?</p>
<p>The moment of doom is not a great time to discover just what money <em>can’t</em> buy. Don’t put yourself in a position where your life would end in cardiac arrest if any of your equipment croaked.</p>
<p>For many with the flexibility of a nomadic lifestyle, data is your most valuable possession. Protect it with the <strong><a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/">3-2-1 backup strategy</a>:</strong> create 3 independent backups with 2 external hard drives and an online service like <a href="https://www.crashplan.com/">CrashPlan</a> for your 3rd backup.</p>
<p>When swapping out equipment becomes a non-event, you’ve achieved Replaceability. After 3 laptops and 7 clean reinstalls of macOS, my personal configuration takes little time to replicate thanks to <a href="https://github.com/nybblr/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> and a <a href="https://gist.github.com/nybblr/0bb105c7b1eba4c54da5">macOS configuration script</a>.</p>

<h2 id="yourturn">Your turn!</h2>
<p>The nomadic lifestyle eliminates worry while enabling you to take advantage of life’s unforeseeable opportunities, and it’s a mindset that you can adopt now! So don’t wait until you decide you’re ready to travel—prepare for it now, and you may find it to be a lifestyle that befits you even at home.</p>
<p>Get comfortable with less, eliminate sources of inbound clutter and attach a cost to existing items. Your reward for a well-culled “stuff life” is a quality portfolio that is accessible anywhere, easy to replace and friendly to spontaneity.</p>

<p>Last time, <a href="https://blog.yellowscale.com/2016/10/15/stuff-is-ruining-your-life/">we mused on the downsides of owning too much stuff</a>. During my foray into digital nomadism, I’ve consolidated what I do and don’t need to live at home or on the go. So with the last post’s philosophy adjourned, I’ve put together a list of <strong>24 things I intentionally own and don’t own as a digital nomad.</strong></p>
<h3 id="dontgotdontwant">Don’t got, don’t want.</h3>
<p>Here’s what you <strong>won’t</strong> find in my residence anytime soon.</p>
<p><strong>1. A big closet.</strong> Stuff requires storage space, and storage space invites more stuff—it’s a disturbingly recursive relationship.</p>
<p><strong>2. A large wardrobe.</strong> If it takes me more than a minute to come up with an outfit in the morning, I either have too many good choices (not the worst predicament) or too many uncoordinated options (more often the case). As a courtesy to myself, I only keep the garments I unreservedly love to wear—then any choice is a surefire winner!</p>
<p><strong>3. A shoe gallery.</strong> Shoes take up a lot of space when traveling, so a gaggle of single purpose pairs makes for a lousy packing experience. I pack flip-flops, loafers for business, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Merrell-Mens-Gore-Tex-Hiking-Chocolate/dp/B001FYVMCA/?tag=nybblr08-20">waterproof Merrell hiking shoes</a> for everything else. I’m not sold on the look of hiking shoes, but they are definitely my go-to pair for travel and day trips.</p>
<p><strong>4. A loaded dishwasher.</strong> The more dishes I own, the less inclined I am to reuse them throughout the day. Thus the Great American <s>marital argument</s> exclamation: “The dishes are piling up in the sink, Honey!” I’m keeping my dishes pretty and few.</p>
<p><strong>5. A furniture outlet.</strong> Furniture has a habit of accumulating and won’t head out the door as easily as I will for my next adventure. If I can’t comfortably move it myself or with a friend’s help, it has no business in my life. I’d rather invest the money, space and time in something more life-changing than a solid oak entertainment center and professional movers.</p>
<p><strong>6. TV service.</strong> My family “ditched the dish” when I was 12, and we haven’t looked back. With the rise of services like Netflix, it’s easy to find movies on demand without obscene commercials. So why waste an average of $99/month and 35 hours a week on the tube?</p>
<p><strong>7. TV screen.</strong> Since I’ve opted out of television service, I enjoy titles right off my laptop. While it’s difficult to enjoy movies with friends, it’s also a welcome incentive to play games, enjoy conversation or read books together. Old-fashioned? Yessir, and right nice it is.</p>
<p><strong>8. Stereo system.</strong> I do love playing background music for guests, so I may opt for a couple Sonos speakers someday, but a 5.1 surround sound system is not in the forecast.</p>
<p><strong>9. Home phone.</strong> Mobile phones are ubiquitous, and when I need high quality audio I rely on VoIP solutions. No need to send a change-of-phone-number notice when I move!</p>
<p><strong>10. (Fancy) car.</strong> I find a personal vehicle freeing and cheap in the long term, but sitting in traffic and keeping up with maintenance and insurance can be stressful (not to mention costly). Biking is pretty cool if the office is nearby. Do the math: can I carpool? Take public transportation? Uber? Sometimes the stress of using these services outweighs the potential savings, but I know for sure that an <em>expensive</em> car is not in my future.</p>
<p><strong>11. Magazine-cover bed.</strong> Sleep is important, but a 300-pound king-sized bed is probably 95% fashion statement and 5% a good night’s sleep. A well arranged bedroom is definitely a “happy place,” but I’d rather take the minimalist approach than splurge on a space I won’t want to leave for a new adventure.</p>
<p><strong>12. Paper records.</strong> Nada, zilch. Not even sticky notes stick around for long. Reams of paper are an information crisis waiting to happen—a good <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/">3-2-1 digital backup plan</a> is always a better solution.</p>
<h3 id="hazwillkeep">Haz, will keep.</h3>
<p>With the closet cleared out, here’s what has survived my nomadic lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong>1. Hammock.</strong> I ousted the traditional European mattress for an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ENO-Eagles-Nest-Outfitters-DoubleNest/dp/B001DDPGNO/?tag=nybblr08-20">ENO doublenest camping hammock</a>. This makes for a fun table-talk topic! I won’t belabor why hammocks make an awesome bed, <a href="http://www.criticalcactus.com/hammock-sleeping-benefits/">as other folks have done a much better job</a>. As for hammock accessories, look no further than $5 worth of paracord: it’s like that irritating guy who earned three degrees and speaks five languages fluently. Paracord just solves everything.</p>
<p><strong>2. Standup desk.</strong> My living is made at a desk, so a quality piece of furniture that supports me for 9+ hours a day is worth the space and investment. I use a <a href="https://www.geekdesk.com/sit-to-stand-adjustable-height-desk-v3">GeekDesk</a>, but rarely change height since I use a barstool, so it’s cheap to modify an existing desk.</p>
<p><strong>3. A few quality clothes.</strong> Why own 25 cotton tees that fit so-so and are miserable in hot weather, instead of owning 5 shirts that look great and are made of materials that perform well in inclement weather? For travel, I follow the three-layer system: 3 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Icebreaker-Merino-Everyday-Sleeve-Crewe/dp/B00AF6ZKL8/?tag=nybblr08-20">Icebreaker merino wool shirts</a> for the base layer, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Patagonia-Mens-Down-Sweater-Hoodie/dp/B073RP8KSK/?tag=nybblr08-20">Patagonia down jacket</a> for the mid-layer, and an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Outdoor-Research-Helium-Jacket-Glacier/dp/B005BV87WQ/?tag=nybblr08-20">Outdoor Research Helium rain jacket</a> for the outer layer. Whether I’m headed for 80 degrees or 20 degrees, I’m covered.</p>
<p>I have a dressier wardrobe for extended stays, but I avoid 100% cotton and opt for polyester/nylon blends that can stand the rigors of travel and sink washes. All told, my entire wardrobe (blazer included) fits in a carry-on sized duffel bag.</p>
<p><strong>4. Just enough comforts to welcome friends.</strong> I was raised in the South, so hospitality was a big part of growing up. Unfortunately, hospitality seems to strive with my minimalist habits for mastery, so I’ve settled on a few tokens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some good games</li>
<li>Candles and lighting to set the mood</li>
<li>A place for friends at the table</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. An exercise routine.</strong> Staying healthy on the move is tough, but regular aerobics, weight training and stretching make my body more resilient during back-to-back travel. I have been using the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/P90X3-DVD-Workout-Base-Kit/dp/B00TQ8FSWC/?tag=nybblr08-20">P90X3 workouts</a> for 6 months—about half the exercises require nothing more than a carpeted floor, but the rest need only a pull-up bar and hand weights.</p>
<p><strong>6. A “Third place”</strong> other than home or the office where I am a regular, like a coffee shop or coworking space. Especially when traveling alone, this gives me a regular way to connect with people and feed off the collective synergy when I need a productivity boost.</p>
<p><strong>7. Internet connectivity</strong> is a non-negotiable for my job and vacations alike. I rely entirely on connectivity to get directions, translations and make reservations. I’m still waiting for <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/11/spacex-plans-worldwide-satellite-internet-with-low-latency-gigabit-speed/">satellite internet</a> to become affordable and portable, but meantime I settle for so-so data coverage. If you’re savvy, you can purchase a prepaid SIM card and save on data charges, <a href="http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/Prepaid_SIM_with_data">but be prepared for some homework</a>. I’ve opted to switch to T-Mobile so I don’t need to purchase expensive roaming plans.</p>
<p><strong>8. Smartphone.</strong> The smartphone is the single greatest gift to the nomadic lifestyle. Without it and a cornucopia of apps, I’d be too chicken to step off the plane! And with a good data plan, I can tether my laptop to truly work from anywhere. Here’s a smattering of apps on my phone’s home screen:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wallet</strong> for plane tickets.</li>
<li><strong>1Password</strong> for secure access to copies of my IDs, credit cards and passwords.</li>
<li><strong>Google Maps ± Waze</strong> for getting places. <a href="https://support.google.com/maps/answer/6291838">Offline maps is downright lifesaving</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Google Translate</strong> because it’s fun to use the offline mode to spew out bits of German or Polish!</li>
<li><strong>Google Calendar</strong> because working from anywhere hasn’t made timezones second nature yet.</li>
<li><strong>TripIt</strong> for organizing all my travel reservations in one app for offline access.</li>
<li><strong>White Noise</strong> to block out noisy hotel neighbors without packing a noise maker.</li>
<li><strong>Cash</strong> for fee-free person-to-person payments in the US.</li>
<li><strong>Slack</strong> for real-time chat with my colleagues.</li>
<li><strong>Gmail</strong> because Apple mail doesn’t handle labels well.</li>
<li><strong>Dropbox</strong> for quick backups and file transfers.</li>
<li><strong>iBooks</strong> so I can finish reading Charles Dickens and J.R.R. Tolkien.</li>
<li><strong>Uber</strong> for convenient rides throughout the US.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9. A tiny laptop.</strong> I’m a fulltime software developer and photographer living off a 13” MacBook Pro. I’m eyeing the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EIUDHGG/?tag=nybblr08-20">12” MacBook</a> for its weight (the 13” is feeling heavy lately) and form factor once it gets a spec boost—unless I need to do serious video editing, the 12” handles my work and hobby needs.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if I’m at home or on the go—the outlets are always in the wrong place. I pack a cheap flathead extension cord so I can squeeze it behind furniture and charge a few other devices simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>10. Laptop daypack</strong> for travel and day trips. I use a 17 liter North Face daypack (discontinued, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/North-Face-Jester-Backpack-Black/dp/B00OS67V6S/?tag=nybblr08-20">here’s a larger one</a>), and thanks to a strict packing regime it holds everything I need for indefinite travel!</p>
<p><strong>11. Car phone charger.</strong> A dying smartphone in a new country is a sure-fire way to strain an already stretched day from timezones and layovers. However, setting it on fire with a cheap charger is also ill-advised, so stick with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-PowerDrive-iPhone-Galaxy/dp/B00VH84L5E/?tag=nybblr08-20">well-reviewed chargers</a>.</p>
<p><strong>12. TSA-friendly sick kit.</strong> The immune system hits an all-time low when traveling. Usually I deal with mundane ailments like headaches or cramps, so thankfully the remedies are compact: hand soap under 3 oz., ibuprofen, loratadine, herbal tea bags, and a miracle heating pad that helps with headaches, cramps, aches and chills: <em>a rice bag.</em> <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Rice-Sock">Rice bags are trivial to make</a>: double up a couple baseball socks and fill it with cheap rice, then warm it in the microwave for a few minutes.</p>
<p>Oh, and do nab those eye shades from the flight—street lights have a way of seeping through hotel doors and windows. Shades beat wasting time and energy blocking up all the light sources with towels!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“...strange!”</p>
<p>“...Hipster.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And “generally sick.”</p>
<p><strong>“Next you’ll put your bed in your closet,”</strong> my family has told me more than once. (They’re probably right.)</p>
<p>Before adopting the nomadic mindset, I hated traveling. Scrutinizing crumbling sculptures and searching for B&amp;B’s at 2 AM never appealed to me.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://500px.com/nybblr">Then I took up photography</a>.</strong> Suddenly new scenery, new cultures and new experiences fascinated me. In just under three years, I’ve trekked through Scotland, Germany, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, Poland and a handful of (mid)western states.</p>
<p><a href="https://500px.com/nybblr"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/10/collage.jpg" alt="European Collage"></a></p>
<p>This newfound interest in long-term travel exposed many shortcomings in my materialistic existence. I don’t own much, but it’s enough to make a three-month trip abroad a logistical nightmare.</p>
<p>This reality hit me when my family moved from Atlanta, where we had lived for 18 years. We spent 2 years emptying the attic/basement/garage, cleaning out moldy nooks and consolidating our wardrobes.</p>
<p><strong>The final move was <em>still</em> a nightmare.</strong></p>
<p>There was certainly no way our family could uproot to another state on a whim, much less another continent. <strong>There was just way too much stuff.</strong> We didn’t want or need most of it, but it had become part of our lives. And while I wasn’t the worst offender, it still might take a dozen Advil just to move my own stuff.</p>
<p>If I wanted to travel long-term—to spend a few weeks in Germany, fly to Greenland for the weekend, then hang out in Monterey for the summer—my closet had to downsize.</p>
<p>I found myself questioning every item in my room. Even with my lean habits and (what I considered extreme) regular consolidation, I still found I had a lot of “stuff” that I didn’t really need. <strong>Why was I attached to things that caused me anxiety and stress?</strong> Was I just being extreme? Over-the-top OCD about owning too much stuff?</p>
<p>Or, was I rubbing up against an unhealthy cultural “norm”—one that frowns on an empty house?</p>
<h2 id="meldingmindsets">Melding mindsets.</h2>
<p>I assumed I was just eccentric, but after two years of moves and travels, I’ve realized that <em>culture</em> has conditioned me with the wrong expectations.</p>
<p>Armed with experience from international trips, I began to pack smarter and lighter, bringing only what I would use on a daily basis (accounting for a trip to the laundromat).</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.yellowscale.com/2016/01/06/19-tips-for-international-travelers-adventurers-edition/">As I began to nail effective packing,</a> I considered an unorthodox challenge: <strong>if I can live this way comfortably for a few weeks internationally, could I embrace this minimalistic mindset all the time?</strong> Could I break myself away from extraneous conveniences and comforts that don’t really enhance my daily existence?</p>
<h2 id="stuffmultipliesproblems">Stuff multiplies problems.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“There’s no set amount of possessions that will make a person happy.”<br>
—<a href="http://elitedaily.com/life/culture/signs-your-possessions-own-you/1033935/">Emily Torres</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Anything you cannot relinquish when it has outlived its usefulness possesses you, and in this materialistic age a great many of us are possessed by our possessions.”<br>
—Peace Pilgrim</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our materialistic society loudly advertises an endlessly growing list of “must-haves.” <em>“You need a roomy house, car, entertainment center and clothes.”</em> Ironically, running that through a translator a few times yields a much more honest, <em>“You need a crippling mortgage, car payment, cable bill and an unhealthy obsession with brimming closets.”</em></p>
<p>These things aren’t enhancing life—they are stealing it from us, and the comfort they offer is usually outweighed. <strong>“Whatever you have, has you.”</strong> Too many possessions, and our lives become squandered in meaningless maintenance and worry.</p>
<p>Maybe if we got out of our closets and away from the TV, <strong><a href="https://blog.yellowscale.com/2016/04/20/yosemite-national-park/">we could experience life instead of a commercial</a>.</strong></p>
<h2 id="appraisingyourthings">Appraising your things.</h2>
<p>Ask yourself how devastated you would be if your apartment burned to the ground. How much of your life would the flames steal?</p>
<p>Getting rid of stuff is hard, but if you can boil your clutter intuitions down to some common factors, you’ll find decluttering much easier.</p>
<p>Things hold value for a few different reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>They enable new experiences.</strong> Camera equipment powers my photography, and a nice dining room table facilitates hospitality.</li>
<li><strong>They are aesthetic by nature</strong> and thus intrinsically enjoyable. Pleasing decor or nice candles can brighten up your day.</li>
<li><strong>They preserve memories</strong> of an experience. Antiques remind you of a loved one, and outfits may hasten you back to overseas shopping treks with a friend.</li>
<li><strong>They make life comfortable.</strong> A dishwasher and a couch make life pleasant.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best things in life help you do all of these, but my nomadic side favors the first bullet most: <strong>experience enabling.</strong></p>
<h2 id="qualifysuccesswithgoalorientedmetrics">Qualify success with goal-oriented metrics.</h2>
<p>As an experience-driven person, I need to qualify what a successful nomadic lifestyle looks like for me. In particular, I want to be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comfortably travel for several weeks out of a backpack.</li>
<li>Live comfortably in one place.</li>
<li>Pack confidently for an international trip in under an hour.</li>
<li>Move my life in a sedan (excluding furniture) when I move between apartments.</li>
<li>Take a trip within a trip with little repacking or prior planning.</li>
<li>Burn my home down with little adverse affect. Although I don’t recommend arson, it’s a useful thought experiment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Am I there yet? Not by a long shot, but now I know exactly how to hold my materialism in check to make sure I’m not accumulating more junk.</p>
<h2 id="perhapsnomadismisntyourthing">Perhaps nomadism isn’t your thing.</h2>
<p>You’ve read this far, but before we skydive further into the nomadic lifestyle, let’s make sure I’m not wasting your time.</p>
<p>This lifestyle may not be for you if:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>You’re sentimental</strong> and your memories are tied to things, like furniture and antiques from family.</li>
<li><strong>You value things</strong> over experiences. Would you rather spend $1000 on a new laptop or a trip to Disneyland?</li>
<li><strong>You don’t enjoy or plan to travel.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>These preferences aren’t always clear cut, but they may shed light on what tends to bring you more enjoyment.</p>
<p>If you’re still interested after that disclaimer, next post will focus on more pragmatic tips from my incomplete journey to digital nomadism.</p>
<p>Until then, you’ll find me in an empty closet. <em>I’m trying to make room for the bed…</em></p>

<img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/04/185A6624.jpg" alt="Hiking, Starving & Freezing on Sentinel Dome"><p><strong>Last summer, we vacationed in Yosemite National Park.</strong> This 1,190 square mile utopia is easily one of the most scenic areas in the US and is ranked among the most beautiful destinations on earth. <em>Everything here is massive:</em> the mountains, cliffs, falls, pinecones—a sharp contrast to California’s delicate food portions and dainty water supply. Reminiscing over our two-week adventure brings back warm fuzzies to our hearts and gnawing pangs to our stomachs. <em>(We were always hungry on this trip.)</em></p>
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/139290481" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p><em><a href="https://vimeo.com/139290481">Yosemite Lenscape: A Travel Montage</a> on Vimeo.</em></p>
<p>In preparation for this grand trek, Jon got a <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/579908-REG/Glidecam_HD_4000_HD4000_Stabilizer_System.html">glidecam</a>, travel-size <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1010691-REG/manfrotto_mt190xpro4_190xpro3_aluminum_tripod.html">tripod</a>, neutral density filter, and <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/822261-REG/Sirui_BSRK20_K_20x_Ball_Head.html">ballhead</a>. We also made a last-minute trip to TJ Maxx and Ross for backpacks and athletic wear.</p>
<p>Not wanting a bunch of luggage to complicate travel, we challenged ourselves to fit everything into one bag each (except camera equipment). <strong>To pull this off, we packed with minimalist efficiency.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/04/FullSizeRender.jpg" alt="Hiking, Starving & Freezing on Sentinel Dome"></p>
<ul>
<li>Computer and accessories (charger, headphones, etc)</li>
<li>Cosmetics (travel-size when possible)</li>
<li>Clothes
<ul>
<li>3 moisture-wicking shirts <em>(not cotton)</em></li>
<li>2 pairs of shorts</li>
<li>Pants <em>(wore on the plane to save room)</em></li>
<li>Cold weather jacket <em>(wore on plane).</em> <a href="http://www.patagonia.com/us/product/mens-ultralight-down-hoody?p=84767-0">Here’s a top-rated down jacket that stores into its own pocket</a>.</li>
<li>Lightweight sweater <em>(wore on plane)</em></li>
<li>Hiking shoes <em>(wore on plane)</em></li>
<li>Compression pants <em>(for extra warmth)</em></li>
<li>PJ’s</li>
<li>Bathing suit</li>
<li>5 pairs of underwear</li>
<li>3 pairs of athletic socks</li>
<li>Gloves</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With some creative packing and folding, we squeezed a two-week trip into one daypack apiece (we love these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/North-Face-Pinyon-Backpack-Yellow/dp/B00EP08Q16/?tag=nybblr08-20">15-liter</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/North-Face-Prewitt-Backpack-Meridian/dp/B00EP08MPG/?tag=nybblr08-20">17-liter</a> bags).</p>
<p><strong>Yes,</strong> if you habitually bring a few bags for a major trip, <strong>you’ll find this quite the shift,</strong> but we both agree that we didn’t really sacrifice anything to go this light. How many of your shirts and fancy jeans come home unused after a trip? Keep that in mind and pack only what you will absolutely use on a daily basis. In lieu of a stash of sweaters and jackets, pack multipurpose clothing that will layer well. For sub-30° weather, <strong>plan on a 3-layer system of a moisture-wicking shirt, down jacket, and windbreaker.</strong></p>

<h3 id="day1sundaymay10">Day 1: Sunday, May 10</h3>
<p>We arrived bleary-eyed at the Atlanta airport <em>very</em> early in the morning and got a lift from an unusually chipper shuttle driver to the terminal. Having “digital tickets” on our phones and keeping liquids/technology in easily accessible compartments made check-in and security a breeze. Jon brought us the breakfast of champions while we waited by our gate:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/04/IMG_1105-1.jpg" alt="Hiking, Starving & Freezing on Sentinel Dome"></p>
<p>Our assigned seats were originally on opposite sides of the airplane, but an obliging passenger swapped seats with us so the three of us could sit together! Josh read the Giver, until we passed through some nerve-wracking turbulence that felt like <em>racing a shopping cart down a flight of concrete stairs.</em></p>
<p>We were surprised to find San Francisco cold. And gray. Not the most exciting introduction to the West Coast, but the train ride was fun! We indulged a second breakfast of luxurious apple fritters and Pete’s Coffee.</p>
<p>Car rental was a pain because the agency wanted to overcharge us for the young driver fee, but we were able to negotiate it back down thanks to Jon’s backup reservation. Lesson of the day: <strong>don’t be intimidated by car rental agencies.</strong> Rates are insanely lucrative and change on a whim. <strong>Find a manager and get it fixed.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/04/185A6386.jpg" alt="Hiking, Starving & Freezing on Sentinel Dome"></p>
<p>After haggling over the car rental, we hit the road for our final stretch to Yosemite. We stopped at Chili’s midway for munchies. Josh got Cajun chicken pasta, and Jon got this mouth-watering sweet-and-smoky burger:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/04/IMG_1138-1.jpg" alt="Hiking, Starving & Freezing on Sentinel Dome"></p>
<p>Since we were about to drive into the middle of nowhere, we made a grocery stop at the next door Target, then a Starbucks stop (S’mores Frappuccinos and raspberry swirl pound cake with our birthday gift cards!). <em>Had we but known how long it would be before we tasted coffee again…</em></p>
<p>There was plenty of scenery during our three-hour drive to Yosemite. The yellow plains soon grew into mountains, shadows lengthened, and Josh ignored it all while reading The Giver in the backseat. We drove through canyons looming higher than we could see out the window. Finally...our lodging! <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Yosemite+Cedar+Lodge/@37.6601018,-119.8523659,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x9a0b0d9db8ab6f7d">Cedar Lodge</a> is one of a few places remotely close to the park entrance, and they have two pools and a hot tub. The lodge also boasts a fabulous front-seat view of mountains covered with arid bushes and grasses. That evening, we began our sumptuous diet of lunchmeat sandwiches, almond milk, peanut butter smothered bananas, and Gatorade.</p>
<p>Sharing a queen-sized bed took a <em>lot</em> of getting used to.</p>
<h3 id="day2mondaymay11">Day 2: Monday, May 11</h3>
<p>We woke up <em>much</em> later than we had planned. After a meager breakfast of peanut butter bananas and cereal (the fridge froze our poor almond milk), we headed out to witness a beautiful sunrise atop the mountains. Although Cedar Lodge is one of the closest hotels to the park, it still took a half hour to reach the park entrance.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/04/185A6439.jpg" alt="Hiking, Starving & Freezing on Sentinel Dome"></p>
<p>Just past the entrance, we pulled up beside a rocky river. Jon snapped some photos and video footage with the glidecam while Joshua played gaffer boy.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/04/IMG_1246.JPG" alt="Hiking, Starving & Freezing on Sentinel Dome"></p>
<p>After hanging out by the rapids for far too long, we sneaked in a quick visit to Lower Yosemite Falls before heading back to the hotel. Same sunset, same dinner. <strong>Today’s lesson: almond milk separates after being frozen and becomes inedible.</strong></p>
<h3 id="day3tuesdaymay12">Day 3: Tuesday, May 12</h3>
<p>This time we journeyed deeper into the park and explored <strong>Wawona Road</strong> for the more iconic Yosemite sites. The Tunnel View framed an incredible <em>triple-punch shot</em> of Yosemite Falls, El Capitan, and Half Dome.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/04/185A6496-1.jpg" alt="Hiking, Starving & Freezing on Sentinel Dome"></p>
<p>A left onto <strong>Glacier Point Road</strong> took us up thousands of feet into the nosebleed zone. Nothing around here is a short drive...it took over 30 minutes to ascend to Glacier Point. Thankfully, our car’s satellite radio had a classical music station, which perfectly complimented the sights (and <em>always</em> lost connection at the most stirring portions).</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/04/185A6550.jpg" alt="Hiking, Starving & Freezing on Sentinel Dome"></p>
<p>We stopped at <strong>Washburn Point</strong> halfway up, which was mind-numbingly surreal. A steep, rolling drop and a front seat view of <strong>Half Dome</strong> makes you feel like you’re sitting on a giant amphitheater. Jon shot plenty of video footage.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/04/185A6514.jpg" alt="Hiking, Starving & Freezing on Sentinel Dome"></p>
<p>After some nauseating hairpin turns on the cliffside, we arrived at <strong>Glacier Point</strong>...the parking lot at least. The hike to the actual spot is only steps away, making this the easiest hike we’ve ever made in backpacking history. We found out quickly how much altitude affects temperature (i.e. it was freezing). Also, our diet of “starvation” left our stomachs gnawing for grub. Fortunately, there was a <s>hiking tourist trap</s> gift shop up there.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/04/IMG_1405.JPG" alt="Hiking, Starving & Freezing on Sentinel Dome"></p>
<p>We grabbed several packs of peanut butter crackers. (Since this trip, Josh has fallen in love with peanut butter.)</p>
<p>We could only take in the landscape for so long; Jon wanted to capture some sunset pictures, so we feasted on crackers and Gatorade in the car for two hours.</p>
<p>After hanging around, we headed back down Glacier Point Road and stopped at the trailhead for <strong>Sentinel Dome.</strong> While not as trite a hike as Glacier Point, it took no more than half an hour to reach the top. Consequently, we arrived an hour earlier than we expected, so we had to weather punishing winds while awaiting the sunset. We had worn shorts and compression pants expecting 50’s weather, but the blustery 40’s kept us huddled together on a bare rock. Josh played <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y51ygBRANM">Daphnis et Chloe</a> on his phone to pass the time.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/04/185A6743.jpg" alt="Hiking, Starving & Freezing on Sentinel Dome"></p>
<p><em>Thankfully, Providence took pity on us poor souls:</em> we met some German angels who had a stash of chocolate they wanted to part with, which we hungrily wolfed down. At the time it was the best chocolate we had ever tasted.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/04/185A6624.jpg" alt="Hiking, Starving & Freezing on Sentinel Dome"></p>
<p>Back on <strong>El Portal Road,</strong> we had a stunning evening view of <strong>El Capitan</strong> and the tall pines.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/04/185A6793.jpg" alt="Hiking, Starving & Freezing on Sentinel Dome"></p>
<p>Jon nearly got run over while frisking about the pavement with his glidecam, while Josh insisted that a hippie-looking van should be featured in the photo album.</p>
<h3 id="day4wednesdaymay13">Day 4: Wednesday, May 13</h3>
<p>The next morning, we returned to the Sentinel Dome trailhead and hiked up to <strong>Taft Point;</strong> much of our video footage is from this stop. Its claim to fame is a 7503-foot sheer drop into Yosemite Valley. Two tightropers had set up their equipment between the ledges—good thing they had a safety net! We never got to see them walk it.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/04/185A6863.jpg" alt="Hiking, Starving & Freezing on Sentinel Dome"></p>
<p>We retraced our steps back into <strong>Yosemite Valley</strong> and up a new road—<strong>Tioga Road</strong>—that splits off just past the park entrance. With the elevation change, the temperature dropped significantly. The snowy stretch lasted an agonizing hour and a half, but our destination, <strong>Tenaya Lake,</strong> was absolutely worth the exhaustion and bathroom jokes.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/04/185A6939.jpg" alt="Hiking, Starving & Freezing on Sentinel Dome"></p>
<p>Surrounded by a vast assembly of green firs and set at the foot of snow-capped mountains, this lake habitat belongs on the front cover of National Geographic.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/04/185A7027.jpg" alt="Hiking, Starving & Freezing on Sentinel Dome"></p>
<h3 id="day5thursdaymay14">Day 5: Thursday, May 14</h3>
<p>Due to the continuing snow (yes, in May), Tioga Road was closed, so we headed south to see the Redwoods. Whispers of mutiny over insufficient rations prompted us to pick a destination that would take us conveniently close to a town, so we headed to <strong>Mariposa Grove.</strong> Because parking is rarely available at the Grove, we parked at the Wawona Hotel and General Store for the shuttle stop. While we waited for the next bus, Josh spotted lupine and braved the snow/rain mix to get an up-close view.</p>
<p><em>After a nerve-wracking cliffside bus ride,</em> we arrived at Mariposa Grove to find the trails packed with tourists likewise braving the snowfall. The mammoth trees were interesting but seemed overrated. Josh and Mom both smuggled a colossal pinecone under their jackets. (Those jackets <em>still</em> have sap on them.)</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/04/IMG_1693.JPG" alt="Hiking, Starving & Freezing on Sentinel Dome"></p>
<p>With our day rained out, we drove down to Oakhurst for some Italian food at <a href="http://www.diciccos.com/ca/oakhurst/41">Di Cicco’s</a>. It was quite good, though not as rich as its Californian price tag. After dinner, we went to Starbucks for delicious S’mores Frappuccinos.</p>
<p><em>They had these awesome Yosemite metal prints in their shop, too!</em></p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/04/IMG_1691.jpg" alt="Hiking, Starving & Freezing on Sentinel Dome"></p>
<h3 id="day6fridaymay15">Day 6: Friday, May 15</h3>
<p>The morning was overcast. We visited the misty <strong>Bridal Veil Falls,</strong> which was less than stunning after being spoiled by more jaw-dropping views. Still, upheld between fog-capped groomsmen, the Bride was worth the short hike.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/04/185A7261.jpg" alt="Hiking, Starving & Freezing on Sentinel Dome"></p>
<p>From there, we went up <strong>Big Oak Flat Road</strong> and took some footage at a hidden road called <strong>Yosemite National Park Road.</strong> The mist played to our advantage and set the tone for a dramatic, <em>Tuscany-like</em> landscape. Josh gawked at more lupine.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/04/IMG_1940.jpg" alt="Hiking, Starving & Freezing on Sentinel Dome"></p>
<p>In <strong>Yosemite Valley,</strong> we spotted a panoramic view and crawled along the cliffside wall to catch it (the road was too narrow for a pedestrian lane). Josh’s pants discovered bird droppings while we shot and was obliged to take off his jeans with only compression pants on. No fun.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/04/185A7394.jpg" alt="Hiking, Starving & Freezing on Sentinel Dome"></p>
<h3 id="day7saturdaymay16">Day 7: Saturday, May 16</h3>
<p>We desperately hoped Tioga Road would be open on our last day in Yosemite, but found out at the park entrance that it had been closed. Disheartened, we headed back to <strong>Glacier Point</strong> and dropped Mom off to paint. We then made for the “U-turn” just before the Glacier Point parking lot, which afforded an unobscured panoramic view with Half Dome. Jon shot some time lapses and we scrambled up a giant rock to get a sweeter view of the U-turn.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/04/185A7689.jpg" alt="Hiking, Starving & Freezing on Sentinel Dome"></p>
<p>Later, we were delighted to learn Tioga Road had reopened for the day, so we seized our last opportunity to see <strong>Tenaya Lake</strong> again. Along the way, we drove through impressive pockets of snow between on-and-off rainfall.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/04/185A7732.jpg" alt="Hiking, Starving & Freezing on Sentinel Dome"></p>
<p>Jon grabbed some time lapses and long exposures of the Lake, Mom labored on a new painting, and Josh slept in the car eating espresso bean trail mix. On the way back, we stopped by <strong>Yosemite National Park Road</strong> for a purple-and-orange sunset—a majestic finale to our visit.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/04/185A7833.jpg" alt="Hiking, Starving & Freezing on Sentinel Dome"></p>
<h2 id="monterey">Monterey</h2>
<h3 id="day1sundaymay17">Day 1: Sunday, May 17</h3>
<p>We checked out of Cedar Lodge in the morning and hit the road, bearing west toward the coast. Per tradition, we stopped at Chili’s and Josh ordered the famed sweet-and-smoky burger. A 3.5-hour commute landed us at the <a href="http://www.visitasilomar.com/">Asilomar Conference Grounds</a> in <strong>Monterey, CA,</strong> where Jon would be teaching a course. The accommodations were ironically outdated and skimpy considering the sky-high prices, but we had somewhat acclimated to that from Cedar Lodge. <em>California seems characterized by sticker shock and mediocrity.</em></p>

<p>While Jon had dinner with his students at Asilomar, Mom and Josh headed over to the artist haven <strong>Carmel-by-the-Sea</strong> for a coastal sunset and some locally baked goods!</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/04/IMG_2395-1.jpg" alt="Hiking, Starving & Freezing on Sentinel Dome"></p>
<h3 id="day2mondaymay18">Day 2: Monday, May 18</h3>
<p>Josh hung out in the Social Hall for the morning, then went piano hunting around campus. (None were in tune, of course.) He even espied a Steinway...rudely locked up in a conference venue. By chance we discovered that seaglass was common to the area, so Josh dragged Mom to a stretch of beach behind a dumpsite and filled a grocery bag with keepsakes.</p>
<h3 id="day3tuesdaymay19">Day 3: Tuesday, May 19</h3>
<p>While Jon taught, Mom and Josh traveled along the West Coast toward <strong>Big Sur,</strong> where gargantuan waves threatened to engulf the beachline. The wild groundcovers were exceptionally colorful: earthy reds, cabbage purple, and a million shades of green. Josh snapped plenty of pictures of the coast.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/04/IMG_2506-1.JPG" alt="Hiking, Starving & Freezing on Sentinel Dome"></p>
<p>For the evening Josh and Mom explored <strong>Carmel-by-the-Sea</strong> and checked out <a href="http://dametracafe.com/">Dametra Cafe</a>. According to Google Reviews, getting a table here without a three-day reservation is unheard of, but we miraculously got a table immediately. This was authentic Greek cuisine at its finest. The two owners from Greece and Jordan had partnered up to found this special restaurant. They personally visited each table and explained the recipes to diners for a personal touch. <em>We even had live entertainment!</em></p>
<p>Josh ordered the Great Greek Salad, featuring one amazingly tasty salad accompanied by freshly-baked pita bread, and Mom got traditional Moussaka, which looks much like lasagna. Packed with eggplant, meat sauce, cheese sauce, and a secret ingredient (cinnamon), this became our favorite eclectic comfort food. We even <a href="http://www.food.com/recipe/kittencals-greek-moussaka-88804">found a recipe to recreate this culinary experience</a>. <em>(Note: it’s not high on the health meter.)</em></p>
<p>We didn’t order dessert and were ecstatic when they brought us a beautiful slice of Baklava to split. Of course there was sauce delicately drizzled all across the plate. This was by far the best restaurant experience we’ve ever had—and one we’ll never forget!</p>
<h3 id="day5thursdaymay21">Day 5: Thursday, May 21</h3>
<p>Jon hosted a movie night for his students while Mom and Josh visited <strong>Carmel-by-the-Sea</strong> again and smuggled back some assorted truffles. That evening we ate well: truffles, almond milk, and some of Jon’s movie night snacks, all in front of the glorious Social Hall fireplace.</p>
<h3 id="day6fridaymay22">Day 6: Friday, May 22</h3>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/04/185A7968.jpg" alt="Hiking, Starving & Freezing on Sentinel Dome"></p>
<p>Jon had not yet seen the West Coast, so we retraced our steps toward <strong>Big Sur</strong> for the day, then headed north to the San Francisco airport for an overnight flight. We had burritos at the Urban Tortilla while waiting by our gate. Big mistake. The flight went from 10 PM to 6 AM (with the time change), and while Jon was a happy flyer, Josh didn’t sleep a minute of the flight. By the time we landed at Atlanta, he was obliged to visited the airport facilities three times.</p>
<p>When we got to the parking lot, Jon found his car battery had died <em>(at which point Josh nearly lost it).</em> We picked up Chick-fil-A biscuits on the way home and landed in bed at noon.</p>
<h2 id="itsbeenayearand">It's Been a Year, and...</h2>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/04/185A7903.jpg" alt="Hiking, Starving & Freezing on Sentinel Dome"></p>
<p><strong>This was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience</strong>—one we’d do all over again in spite of dead batteries, perpetual hunger, shared mattresses, and frozen almond milk. <em>There’s a reason Yosemite National Park maintains its coveted status as the most beautiful national park in the US,</em> and a year later our hearts still flutter at any reference to this western paradise.</p>
<p>In tribute, <strong>we compiled our video footage and took social media by storm with the resulting nature montage,</strong> <a href="https://vimeo.com/139290481">Yosemite Lenscape</a>. Check it out!</p>

<img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/01/23747038139_b1b1213bbd_o.jpg" alt="19 Tips for [Inter]national Travelers: Adventurer Edition!"><p><strong>Two years ago, I’d never been on a plane.</strong> Since then, I’ve traveled through <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/albums/72157644648140858">Scotland</a>, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/albums/72157648228476046">Germany</a>, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/albums/72157648228476046">Austria</a>, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/albums/72157651052238303">Yosemite National Park</a> and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/albums/72157660026195754">Italy</a> with my travel buddy (i.e. my mom).</p>
<p>In our first few whirls about the globe, we felt firsthand the stresses, delights and wish-we-did-that moments of traveling through Europe. We won’t be conquering Italy’s roads anytime soon, but I’ve come away a conqueror in another area: <em>travel logistics.</em></p>
<p>To help you on your journey to conquering airplanes and continents alike, I’ve teased out a list of wish-I’d-known-that guidelines. While they are from a landscape photographer’s perspective, <em>they aren’t limited to shutterbugs.</em> (I have a post just for photographers in the works though!) Travel connoisseurs, hikers or folks who generally just want to enjoy gorgeous views away from tourists may find these sanity-preserving tips useful.</p>
<h2 id="1travellighterthanlight">1. Travel Lighter-than-Light</h2>
<p>Americans have a lot of stuff—leave it at home. <strong>Follow the “one-trip” rule:</strong> pack only as much as you and your companions can drag around in a single trip, without return trips to the car (<a href="https://fstoppers.com/bts/how-i-became-location-independent-travel-photographer-77526">hat tip to Elia Locardi</a>).</p>
<p>Realistically, I take it a step further: imagine you are coddling a cup of coffee, a bag of muffins and your friend’s jacket in a busy airport. <strong>Now</strong> get your bags.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/14345147056"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/01/14345147056_b36c6a9ab2_k.jpg" alt="19 Tips for [Inter]national Travelers: Adventurer Edition!"></a></p>
<p>For the two of us, this works out to <em>4 bags total</em>—2 of which are on wheels (a checked bag and carry-on) while the other 2 sit on top (one checked, the other a carry-on duffel-bag). That’s plenty for the average tourist, but admittedly a near impossibility if you’re taking a hobby with you (i.e. photography and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_plein_air">Plein Air painting</a>).</p>
<p>Sound extreme? Read on. <em>(And if it doesn’t, major respect—I’ve got a long way to go!)</em></p>
<h2 id="2takejusttheclothesonyourback">2. Take Just the Clothes on Your Back</h2>
<p>My packing habits may make nose-wielding companions cringe, but you don’t have to smell or look like a scavenger to travel ultra-light.</p>
<p>I’m a light packer by nature, but without being methodical I often come back with ⅔ of my laundry unused. If I spend more care on packing (fewer) clothes, it forces me to research the weather patterns and potential stops.</p>
<p>For my adventuring regime, <strong>I’ve settled on a modest packing list:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 shirt per 2 days</li>
<li>1 pair of socks per 2 days</li>
<li>1 hoodie and a light, compact winter jacket (like a packable down jacket).</li>
<li>1 extra pair of jeans or shorts (besides the pair you wear on the flight) in case things go south.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whites can easily be the bulkiest part of your wardrobe, and it’s not an area to skimp in, so consider investing in some silk underwear.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>plan on doing a load of laundry halfway:</strong> pack with the previous guidelines for ½ the trip duration, plus 1 day. For example, if you’re traveling for 12 days, pack like it was a 6 + 1 = 7 day trip (3 shirts). $15 for a load of laundry is worth fewer bags, less (back) stress and added ease getting around public transportation.</p>
<p>3 shirts for a 12 day trip may seem unrealistic, but don’t forget you already have an extra outfit: <em>what you’re wearing now!</em> And if you spend your time <strong>exploring</strong> instead of peering into your wardrobe, you may not mind wearing the same shirt twice.</p>
<h2 id="3therollercoastertestieexplorehandsfree">3. The Roller Coaster Test, i.e. Explore Hands-Free</h2>
<p>During our short trip in Italy, reading glasses met the pavement 5 times, our primary credit card went missing at almost every restaurant and we (briefly) gave up our keys for lost.</p>
<p>I highly recommend buying a high quality money belt to organize your essential paraphernalia—make sure you don’t mind wearing it under your shirt. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Venture-Protect-Yourself-Comfortable-Lightweight/dp/B00WBMQ89C/?tag=nybblr08-20">Here’s the one I’ve used.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/23747038139"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/01/23747038139_b1b1213bbd_o.jpg" alt="19 Tips for [Inter]national Travelers: Adventurer Edition!"></a></p>
<p><strong>Second, take the Roller Coaster Test.</strong> This won’t require a trip to Six Flags before your expedition; just ask yourself if you could take all your personal effects (purse, camera bag, glasses…) on a roller coaster. If not, leave them behind at the hotel or in your car, and stick just the essentials in your money belt.</p>
<p>Don’t even think about bringing your Michael Kors purse. Or anything that isn’t strapped to you. <strong>You will lose it.</strong> And stress yourself out. That’s no fun for you or your traveling buddies.</p>
<h2 id="4packpackagain">4. Pack Pack Again</h2>
<p>Packing is like writing a blog post: it takes a few passes before it’s ready for the world. So take advantage of do-overs and <strong>do a mock packing session a couple months before takeoff.</strong> A little too tight? Pack again, and take advantage of any wannabe containers, like plein air easels.</p>
<p>A week before your flight, pack again and make sure everything still fits comfortably within guidelines. Make sure to check for updated weather forecasts so you can repack with more appropriate attire.</p>
<p>If you can’t leave the bag packed for a week, make sure to have all zippers sealed and ready 2 days before your flight. About this time, panic sets in and kindly reminds you of everything you forgot. If you panic early enough, you’ll still have time to run last-minute errands and repack when your carry-on exceeds airline restrictions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/23925076542"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/01/23925076542_beeae5ba8b_o.jpg" alt="19 Tips for [Inter]national Travelers: Adventurer Edition!"></a></p>
<p>For our trip to Italy, we packed 3 months in advance, then 2 weeks out, then 3 days before. It saved us major inconveniences when we discovered some of our luggage had disintegrated, or that some important toiletries needed replacement.</p>
<h2 id="5dontgethangryatme">5. Don’t Get Hangry at Me!</h2>
<p>Grumpiness is well documented to accompany hunger, and is colloquially called “<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Hangry">hangriness</a>.” Compounded with the stress of a foreign environment, hunger can turn your docile travel buddy into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grumpy_Cat">Grumpy Cat</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Prevent hangriness: don’t make food decisions when you’re hungry!</strong> It will make you illogical and irritable, so you’ll settle for unreasonably priced junk food and fume while you munch.</p>
<p>Instead, eat before you’re hungry, then relish in the <a href="http://www.livestrong.com/article/278373-does-exercise-suppress-appetite/">scientific studies which suggest you will eat less overall</a> by avoiding starvation.</p>
<h2 id="6waterwatereverywhere">6. Water Water Everywhere</h2>
<p>Always carry water. Don’t wait until you’re thirsty to tank up: it will often be inconvenient, time consuming and expensive. <strong>Get enough water for the trip at a gas station or grocery store</strong> and leave it in the car so you can refill a backpack-friendly bottle. (Pro tip: Sparkling water is awesome!) Exercise and water are natural appetite suppressants, and will help prevent “hangriness.”</p>
<p>And if the thought of reusing a plastic bottle doesn’t <em>thrill</em> you, refill in style with a space-friendly, <a href="http://www.rei.com/product/868670/hydrapak-softflask-750-outdoor-collapsible-bottle-253-fl-oz">collapsible water bottle</a>!</p>
<h2 id="7passingthroughisfortourists">7. Passing Through is for Tourists</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/15862833612"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/01/15862833612_752a95333d_o.jpg" alt="19 Tips for [Inter]national Travelers: Adventurer Edition!"></a></p>
<p>There are people who like to “hit” all the major towns of a region, see the shops and sights, then move on (usually spending less than a day for a couple cities), but unless you like the beaten path, <strong>avoid the big cities and travel short distances from your hotel.</strong> Plan to stay 2 nights at minimum: if you’re scheduling a 2 week trip to another country, plan on booking no more than 5 hotels.</p>
<p>Travel is already stressful and time consuming, so don’t waste your trip and energy getting from place to place!</p>
<h2 id="8someprostakethebus">8. Some Pros Take the Bus</h2>
<p>Evaluate public transportation carefully. Few states in the US boast decent infrastructure, so the inexperienced (like myself) can be daunted by the bus schedules and train stops. In some countries though, it’s worth every ounce of anxiety!</p>
<p>Driving a personal vehicle around Italy almost ruined the first half of our trip, and was a little pricey. We were amused to find that the train system was ubiquitous even in the tiny villages we visited, and buses covered the rest at dirt cheap rates!</p>
<p>The same can’t be said for all countries however…</p>
<h2 id="9someprosrentacar">9. Some Pros Rent a Car</h2>
<p>Renting a car is cheap (well, if you’re over 25) and can provide unparalleled exploratory freedom in the right countries.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/23637447030"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/01/23637447030_f8bb3e3641_o.jpg" alt="19 Tips for [Inter]national Travelers: Adventurer Edition!"></a></p>
<p>Outside Edinburgh, Scotland is relatively traffic free and a delight to drive through. <strong>The best views are literally off the main road,</strong> so sightseeing is as easy as pulling over.</p>
<p>Driving in Austria and the Bavarian regions of Germany is similar, so make sure to research the country’s public transit system and check with your travel cohorts to ensure rental will be less stressful.</p>
<h2 id="10squarewheelsmightworkbetter">10. Square Wheels Might Work Better</h2>
<p>If you’re tempted to bring lots of wheeled luggage, consider dragging your 50 lb. bags through gravel, up stairs and through buildings without elevators or escalators. You’ll discover quickly how little of that luggage you really “had to bring.” On the other hand, layovers and transit to/from an airport is no fun when your shoulders bear all the weight, so find a balance between wheeled vs un-wheeled luggage.</p>
<p><strong>I recommend a single (lightweight) wheeled bag and one backpack per person.</strong> Then, if you must trek through gravel driveways or up 300 steps in Positano, you won’t indulge your hangriness.</p>
<h2 id="11sideloadingbackpacks">11. Sideloading Backpacks</h2>
<p>I’ve traveled with my handsome daypack as a personal item my last two trips. The side-access zipper is awesome for pulling out my laptop from an otherwise cramped bag.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/23907322626"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/01/23907322626_ce81dd5f46_o.jpg" alt="19 Tips for [Inter]national Travelers: Adventurer Edition!"></a></p>
<p>Well, it was awesome until I forgot to zip it. I later emptied the bag for use around Turin, Italy. With the bag mostly empty, it was pretty easy for the laptop to slide in and out, so when I grabbed the bag and slung it over my shoulder in the bathroom, <strong>my laptop ended up smashed on the tiled floor.</strong> It bent my MacBook body in ways I didn’t think were possible with classical physics, but miraculously it survived. (Another tip: back up your epic keynote presentation on Dropbox.)</p>
<p><em>Key takeaway:</em> if you are going to use your sideloading backpack around the city, <strong>double check that zipper.</strong></p>
<h2 id="12laptopreallybringanipad">12. Laptop, Really? Bring an iPad.</h2>
<p>For that matter, do you really need to bring a laptop? Every pound counts when you have to sling it in airplane bins and up 10 flights of stairs. Even the retina MacBook Pros pack some notable weight and bulk, so unless you have an ultra-thin 12” MacBook, <strong>opt for a tablet.</strong> There’s an app or adapter for just about anything you’ll need (except backing up SD cards, sorry photographers).</p>
<h2 id="13smartphonelife">13. Smartphone = Life</h2>
<p>Beyond my front door, I pretty much rely on my iPhone for everything. Looking up reservations. Airplane tickets + gate changes. Translation. Restaurants. PDF’s of road signs. Maps + GPS in uninhabited haunts or teeming metropolises. Cut the Rope during layovers. If I didn’t have my smartphone and travel apps, I wouldn’t have the nerve to travel. Period.</p>
<p>Yes, decry me as a smartphone dependent, but it makes travel feasible for the average adventurer. <strong>So make sure you have a backup of your phone,</strong> and while you’re at it, <strong>bring a backup phone</strong> (easy if you aren’t traveling alone). And…(cringe)...get a paper map just in case.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/18832414905"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/01/18832414905_2a25c6dbdf_o.jpg" alt="19 Tips for [Inter]national Travelers: Adventurer Edition!"></a></p>
<p>Forget about purchasing special voice plans—spend the money on a data plan. Internet access will get you out of a lot of scrapes.</p>
<p>Your phone is guaranteed to die when you need it most, so <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-PowerDrive-iPhone-Galaxy/dp/B00VH84L5E/?tag=nybblr08-20">purchase a car adapter</a> and thank yourself in advance.</p>
<h2 id="14travelzooco">14. Travelzoo &amp; co.</h2>
<p>Travel deals from Travelzoo, Groupon, etc. are great if you are flexible and live within driving distance of New York’s JFK airport (where most international flights layover). However, <strong>customizations will often put you back at standard prices,</strong> and at the cost of flexibility.</p>
<p>Unless you can grab a travel deal and follow the itinerary to the letter, you may not be saving much (if anything). So make sure to crunch numbers on your own before booking through an agency.</p>
<h2 id="15bookandrebook">15. Book and Rebook</h2>
<p>It’s always prudent to book your flight, car and lodging a few months in advance, but try to get free cancellation where possible.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/18046777591"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/01/18046777591_b3331e3f39_o.jpg" alt="19 Tips for [Inter]national Travelers: Adventurer Edition!"></a></p>
<p>The week and day before your reservation, <strong>check rates again.</strong> If there are too many unreserved rooms/cars, the rates will often plummet as hotels/rental agencies try to attract last minute sales.</p>
<p>Car rentals are especially notorious for drastic price variations. On every trip, <strong>rebooking a day before arrival has cut the rental price in half.</strong> On hotels, I’ve saved a more meager 10–20%.</p>
<h2 id="16leavetheshoegalleryathome">16. Leave the Shoe Gallery at Home</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“No one will be looking at your feet.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sage advice, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ever_After">Gustave</a>.</p>
<p>Just bring waterproof hiking shoes. You don’t have to look like a courtier to impress the locals, though you might bring a compact pair of comfy shoes for the hotel and dinner.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/23932899085"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/01/23932899085_20d046baa8_o.jpg" alt="19 Tips for [Inter]national Travelers: Adventurer Edition!"></a></p>
<h2 id="17getoffthehighway">17. Get Off the Highway</h2>
<p>Make liberal use of the <strong>no toll roads</strong> and <strong>no highways</strong> options when looking up routes in Google Maps. They may take 2–3 times as long, but often lead to photographer gold.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/01/gmaps-screen.png" alt="19 Tips for [Inter]national Travelers: Adventurer Edition!"></p>
<h2 id="18togogroceries">18. To-Go Groceries</h2>
<p>Go cheap on breakfast and lunch with high calorie groceries; this will allow you to see the sights and landscapes during the best hours of the day, instead of wasting $$$ and precious hours searching for food (usually while cranky, see above tip about when to eat).</p>
<p>But treat yourself at dinner—you’ll sleep better and enjoy reminiscing over the day’s experience while planning the next over a quiet meal.</p>
<h2 id="19whenlost">19. When Lost</h2>
<p>Traveling with someone(s)? Plan on going separate ways at any point? <strong>Get walkie talkies.</strong></p>
<p>Cell coverage in the cities will probably be fine, but minutes can be expensive, and if you are following tip no. 7 on not being a tourist, you will find yourself walking through unreal landscapes and tiny villages <em>with no cell coverage.</em></p>
<p>So get a long range walkie talkie handset. Or purchase a fancy iPhone conversion kit like <a href="http://www.beartooth.com/">Beartooth</a>, which will also show you where your lost companions wandered to.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nybblr/15419311232"><img src="https://blog.yellowscale.com/content/images/2016/01/15419311232_0877bd1af2_k.jpg" alt="19 Tips for [Inter]national Travelers: Adventurer Edition!"></a></p>
<h2 id="imaddictednowwhat">I’m Addicted, Now What?</h2>
<p>It’s funny, 2 years ago I didn’t like travel (well, the idea of it at least). I watched my brother visit England in high school and didn’t envy him in the slightest: <em>how could scones and Big Ben make up for the terror of driving in London?</em></p>
<p>So when I was invited to speak at <a href="http://scotlandjs.com/2014/">ScotlandJS 2014</a>, I figured the agonizing 11 hour flight would fortify my opinion of travel. But over the 2 weeks of meeting people, cruising through <em>unbelievable</em> mountains and <em>ethereal</em> landscapes, my opinion eroded.</p>
<p><strong>I came back addicted,</strong> but I also came back a conqueror: <em>I had overcome my fear of travel.</em></p>
