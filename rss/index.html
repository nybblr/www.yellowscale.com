In case you missed it, we just wrapped up a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Yellowscale">two-part vlog series</a> on neutral tones. <em>Neutral tones</em> are desaturated subjects the viewer expects to be grayscale, like clouds, fog, water, snow and architecture.</p>
<p>Once you’ve identified the sources of neutrals, you can take an impressive amount of creative liberty with your landscapes. There are two opposing strategies you can apply:</p>
<ol>
<li>Carefully avoid altering the neutral tones, but freely correct and enhance vibrant colors throughout the image.</li>
<li>Intentionally alter the neutral tones to convey weather, temperature and time of day while leaving the rest of the color palette alone.</li>
</ol>
<p>In both strategies, the neutral tones serve to anchor the rest of the color palette.</p>
<h2 id="1avoidalteringtheneutraltones">1. Avoid altering the neutral tones</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a9pkH3bB-ZU" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>While the vibrant colors in a sunset can be pushed far past their natural saturation before the image falls apart, it takes little adjustment to a neutral tone before the image becomes jarring. That’s because we have preconceptions of how neutral tones should appear, so even the slightest change has incredible influence over the mood of the scene.</p>
<p>Conversely, an image without neutral tones at all may look fake or unbalanced.</p>
<h2 id="2intentionallyalterneutraltones">2. Intentionally alter neutral tones</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PCCTHmoSmsc" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>In direct opposition, you can alter neutral tones to convey environmental factors without disturbing the beautiful color palette throughout the rest of the image. A tiny change to <em>only</em> neutral tones will introduce an exponential amount of mood into your image that no amount of saturation or contrast could otherwise infuse!</p>
<p>In particular, altering only the neutral tones helps convey environmental factors like the weather, temperature and time of day.</p>

I acquire with intentionality, and am twice as fast to un-acquire stuff <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/surround-yourself-with-a-few-things-you-love/">the moment it no longer brings exceptional value</a>.</p>
<p>But in one area, I’m a hopeless clutter addict: <strong>my digital life.</strong></p>
<p>After a decade of computers, I’ve acquired terabytes of digital clutter. Since storage is cheap, I initially embraced a gospel of “delete nothing.”</p>
<p>In trying to coax family and friends into more minimalistic habits, I encouraged them to digitize everything so they could trade physical possessions for cheap digital storage.</p>
<p>What are a few backup hard drives to a garage full of unsearchable memories?</p>
<h2 id="oneisgreaterthanfour">One is greater than four</h2>
<p>That philosophy hasn’t worked well the last few years as I’ve consolidated 2TB onto a 0.5TB laptop — and in keeping with <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/your-map-to-mount-nomad/">the principle of accessibility</a>, I have no plans to carry around external drives with the other 1.5TB.</p>
<p>Now I realize storage isn’t the problem. <strong>Ownership and availability are.</strong> Just like physical possessions, every file I <em>own</em> has mental <em>ownership</em> of me. And while the practical aspect — running out of space on three computers and selling two of them — has forced my hand, it’s been on my mind the last few years. As I aim for accessibility and replaceability, I can’t seem to get my digital life in shape.</p>
<p>If your laptop (and backups) burned up, what would you lose? Would you have anxiety from <em>not</em> knowing the extent of the loss? If I’m preparing to lose or let go of things, I want to have a say in what goes while I have opportunity.</p>
<h2 id="goingthroughthedigitalcloset">Going through the digital closet</h2>
<p>That means letting go of files in exactly the same way I cull through possessions.</p>
<p>When decluttering a room, the easiest place to start is your wardrobe — styles go out of style, and you can only wear one outfit at a time. In the digital realm, that meant a visit to my downloads and design asset folders that were littered with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photoshop brushes, actions and textures that I never even unzipped.</li>
<li>More themes, icons and templates than I care to admit. Did I mention I used to collect Windows Vista icon packs?</li>
<li>Design work that’s over a decade old and I will never, ever want to look at again.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1. When was the last time I used this?</strong></p>
<p>Maybe your digital life isn’t as hopeless as mine, but why on earth would I hold on to unzipped fonts and icons I downloaded 5 years ago?</p>
<p>To start my spring cleaning, I sorted by <em>Date Modified</em> or <em>Last Opened</em> to guesstimate the last time I wandered in the neighborhood.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/10/finder-downloads.png" alt="Digital clutter: cultivating an attitude of minimalism in your digital life"></p>
<p><strong>2. Will I need this in an emergency?</strong></p>
<p>Why are these files in a folder where I’ll never find them? Emergency documents should be accessible and replaceable, which means they should be available online and backed up with 1Password or Dropbox.</p>
<p><strong>3. Does this bring some happiness?</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t use it and you don’t need it, it isn’t bringing happiness. Trash it.</p>
<p><strong>4. Is there already something better that duplicates its purpose?</strong></p>
<p>The downloads folder is a well-meaning sanctuary for duplicates. <code>Bench Report.xlsx</code>, <code>Bench Report (2).xlsx</code>, <code>Bench Report OLD.xlsx</code>. For every file you download, find two that should be trashed or moved to a better home. Need to archive a document for records? Convert to PDF and ditch the source document.</p>
<p><strong>Two hours later,</strong> my downloads and design asset folders are completely empty for the first time in 6 years. In sifting through thousands of files, I found 10 that were meaningful and belonged elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="lettinggoofdigitaljunk">Letting go of digital junk</h2>
<p>Before dropping from 2TB to 1TB, I had already taken practical steps to remove large files. That was easy: I just looked for old raw video files.</p>
<p>But going from 1TB to 0.5TB was infinitely harder because I needed to let the millions of little files go. Large files may weigh my hard drive down, but the millions of little ones weigh <em>me</em> down with anxiety.</p>
<p>Since becoming a digital nomad, I thought I’d gotten over I-might-need-this syndrome. However, my old design work and downloads folder were full of memories, and I liked the security of having something to reminisce over.</p>
<p>It’s the same trap <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/your-map-to-mount-nomad/">I thought I had tackled years ago</a>. It suggests two unrealistic assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>That these files are something I’ll want to reminisce over.</li>
<li>That preserving all of these files in their original format is the best medium to reminisce.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scrapbooking">Scrapbooking</h2>
<p>Some of my friends love to scrapbook. For a while, I thought it was stupid — actually, I still do — but scrapbooking can be a powerful antidote to clutter: it coaxes you to curate hundreds of isolated memories into a cohesive highlights reel.</p>
<p>An image has far more power in a gallery collection than as a single in the closet. Scrapbooking <em>creates</em> from material you’ve already <em>captured.</em> Few things have intrinsic worth: it’s what we invest that takes raw material — family photos or old design work — and turns them into something valuable.</p>
<p><em>Scrapbooking preserves memories in a format worth celebrating.</em> It’s not the material itself, but how you frame it.</p>
<h2 id="digitalscrapbookingforrainydays">Digital scrapbooking for rainy days</h2>
<p>In the digital world, that entails recycling old material — photos, milestones, projects — into a sort of “digital scrapbook.” While the source material might be thrown out, the scrapbook is worth holding on to for reminiscing.</p>
<p>A digital scrapbook can be just about anything: producing a performance highlight from work emails, coalescing old video clips into a YouTube montage, or uploading interior design ideas to a moodboard like <a href="https://niice.co/">Niice</a>.</p>
<p>When a “rainy day” hits and you’re in need of encouragement, you won’t reach for reams of raw, disorganized memories. You will want to reach for a concise, meaningful digital scrapbook.</p>
<p>However, if you frequently find yourself with rainy days and reminiscing over old memories, it might be time to get out of your comfort zone to make new memories. Being comfortable is one of the dreariest, most uncomfortable stages of aging.</p>
<p>Rather than stockpiling old memories for depressing days, <strong>optimize your lifestyle for making new memories over curating the old.</strong></p>
<h2 id="downto400gb">Down to 400GB</h2>
<p>I <em>was</em> a hopeless digital clutter addict. But there just might be hope.</p>
<p>I made one final backup and set up camp on a new 512GB computer. Whether I’m away from backups for a few days or a few years, now I <em>know</em> that I have everything I need with me.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/10/finder-400gb.png" alt="Digital clutter: cultivating an attitude of minimalism in your digital life"></p>
<p>Like moving out of a house, moving to a new computer gets easier each time. You get in the habit of knowing exactly what you will let go of, and what carries meaning. Minimalism is about <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/surround-yourself-with-a-few-things-you-love/">making everything count</a>: anything that doesn’t, goes in the trash (folder).</p>
<p>Apart from a little baking soda, tidying up your hard drive is no different from tidying up the house.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/how-to-lead-the-eye-with-composition-shapes-and-lighting/">A few vlogs ago</a>, we broke down three ingredients of effective landscape photography:</p>
<ol>
<li>Composition</li>
<li>Shapes</li>
<li>Lighting</li>
</ol>
<p>By weaving these three elements together, we can reveal subjects spread throughout the image only as the viewer wanders through the landscape. After editing a shot for too long, it can be difficult to assess the image objectively — one way to reset your artistic senses is to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woq3rZZsC1g">edit the image upside down</a>.</p>
<p>This week, we return to critiquing some images to break down why some images are effective at stalling the viewer’s interest. In particular, panoramas turn out to be a surprisingly difficult format to execute well and secure the viewer’s attention.</p>
<p>Whenever one element — composition, shapes or lighting — is missing, it’s difficult to compensate with the other two. Without enough subjects in the composition, there’s nothing for the shapes to connect, and even a perfect composition won’t mask flat lighting.</p>
<p>As you browse through your portfolio, use this critiquing process as an opportunity to <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/survivorship-bias-why-success-teaches-us-nothing/">turn photos that didn’t work out</a> into learning material so that next time, you can be more intentional.

<p>What is the first image that came to mind? A graphic design style? An interior? An empty, bleak, white-washed room?</p>
<p>Or did it make you think of a lifestyle?</p>
<h2 id="ataleoftwohouses">A Tale of Two Houses</h2>
<p>Like most of our friends and neighbors, my parents had a lot of stuff. Closets, attics, garages, kitchen cabinets… filled to the brim with things that we rarely used and hoped we wouldn’t need. That stuff provided a sense of security and comfort for my parents.</p>
<p>I’m a bit contrarian: all that unused, uncatalogued stuff gave me anxiety. Closed closet doors made me want to pour over their contents to dispel their hidden mysteries. We responded differently to having lots of stuff, but my family had one universal frustration: <strong>the things we did love were drowned out by what we didn’t.</strong></p>
<p>When we entertained guests, we would spend a couple days cleaning, storing and tossing — but with a surplus of knick-knacks, we always had the inevitable temptation to display what we loved alongside mediocre pieces. It wasn’t that we lacked stunning pieces, but that they became diluted by less stunning items that we displayed for sheer need.</p>
<p>It was a bit like merging a fine art portfolio with Instagram selfies.</p>
<p>Last week, my brother Josh moved into his new place. I have to admit, for someone who professes to care little for stuff, I’m a little envious. He has a beautiful space to work from, and with his interior design skills he could turn the space into a gallery (and sell my <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/">fine art photography</a>) or feature it on Houzz.</p>
<p>He owns very little. The space is huge and will remain empty for some time, but the few things he owns display a caliber of taste that fills up the space.</p>
<p>With Josh moved out, I resolved on my drive back to redouble my efforts to get rid of anything superfluous, especially larger furniture that would <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/the-digital-nomad-lifestyle-is-more-about-freedom-and-less-about-travel/">give me a moment’s hesitation</a>. I felt inspired to clean things up a bit, only to find:</p>
<ul>
<li>Now that I have fewer things, it feels empty.</li>
<li>The interior designer in me wants to turn my apartment into an art canvas.</li>
<li>The bathroom screams for a makeover.</li>
<li>I feel the need to fill the space up.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a space is too empty, I feel a bit lonely. When I own too much stuff, I feel attached and anxious about it holding me down. <em>The conflict that stirs within!</em> What shall I do?</p>
<h2 id="theminimalistethos">The Minimalist Ethos</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Surround yourself with (a few) things you love.”<br>
—Me?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Minimalism doesn’t mean owning nothing. Minimalism is an ethos: it means having nothing superfluous, and often that means choosing a few quality things over quantity. Minimalism can be framed in the negative: “Remove everything that is superfluous.” But sometimes I find it a bit contrary to the purpose of minimalism. So I start from the positive: “Be intentional about what you add: only add what brings exceptional value.”</p>
<p>What do I love, and what things make me happier? I have a handful of exceptional things, some that could be considered superfluous:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accent lighting. As a photographer, light strongly affects my mood.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/ultralight-digital-nomad-packing-list/">Travel clothes</a>, and some dressier winter wear that I probably wouldn’t travel with like a scarf and sweater from Ireland.</li>
<li>A few succulents, like lavender and ferns, that remind of my favorite places in the world.</li>
<li>Candles and soaps. Yes guys, roll your eyes — of the five senses, the sense of smell creates the strongest ties to memories and has the strongest recall. I have a candle that smells like the Scottish Highlands and a soap like ferns in the Pacific Northwest. But ironically, my strongest memory trigger to date is a deodorant I used (and hated) while traveling non-stop for three months.</li>
<li>A few small but unique knick-knacks that carry dual value.</li>
<li>A chair that reminds me of the Alps, and a smaller desk chair that reminds me of Norway.</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of these items would be considered superfluous: extra lighting, plants and other decor accents. But “superfluous” implies they bring no value, when in fact they bring exceptional value to me by making my space a place I enjoy living in — but without holding me down.</p>
<p>Every posession you own will have a chance to posess you. Minimalism asks you to be <em>intentional</em> about every item you introduce to your life. Everything has a cost, <em>so make each one count.</em></p>

It usually includes the use of composition, shapes and lighting to encourage a viewer to rove the image in a fashion that tells a story.</p>
<p>The “beats” of a plot line don’t come all at once: they are spaced throughout the story to hold the viewer’s interest. And like any good story, the beats of a captivating landscape image aren’t condensed into one region of the photo.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pn8Sg1cZAGs" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Stories are hard to tell with a still image, but we can imitate a few key components of effective storytelling by slowly revealing new details and subtleties as the viewer dwells on it. It starts with composition, shapes and lighting: these aspects of an image tell a story and communicate a mood by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintaining the viewer’s interest</li>
<li>Drawing attention to the important elements</li>
<li>Helping the viewer skip past the unimportant regions</li>
</ul>
<p>To drive home these three elements, I pulled <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/">five images from my portfolio</a> and broke down why they do — or don’t — deliver on these three elements. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn8Sg1cZAGs">Check out the vlog for the full critique</a>, but here’s a quick peek at how I broke down these images.</p>

Growing up, anything less than an A was unacceptable to me. In college, a 4.0 was mandatory. Those expectations paid off, but didn’t work so well after academia.</p>
<p>When I started <a href="https://jonathanleemartin.com/">full-time software development</a>, that perfectionist tendency carried over. Every line of code was meticulously combed for bugs, or removed altogether during the sixth refactor. Caring about code quality is important, but at some point perfection becomes the enemy of useful: 20 near-perfect lines of code have no utility for our users until they’re shipped.</p>
<p>How do we balance craftsmanship with usefulness? In software development, the cure is to “iterate to perfection”: get your code to 80% quality, have a colleague review the code to get it to 90%, then ship it. Over time, make that code better so it approaches perfection in the long term while still providing utility to your users.</p>
<p><strong>This year has been crazy for photography:</strong> I started writing for two online <a href="https://fstoppers.com/profile/133626/articles">photography</a> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/author/jonathan-martin/">publications</a>, vlogging on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzW75NP8kpRAC-fXKvpl-Q">YouTube</a> and blogging here. As I funnel more time and energy into landscape photography, I’m rediscovering my perfectionist tendencies. After all, photography (and writing) is an art — what artist wants to show or publish less than perfect artwork?</p>
<p>In spending 20–30 hours a week on photography-related work, I find myself improving at shipping things that are 80% “good enough” out of sheer need.</p>
<p>So when I get not-infrequent comments to the effect of “the production quality is awful” or “I just wasted my time reading this,” my first instinct is bitterness. But after a few minutes, it quickly turns into self-reproach: why isn’t my work — vlogs, articles or photos — perfect like the old days?</p>
<p><strong>Should I dig out my old perfectionist tendencies so I can safely return to being my only critic?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Better to do something imperfectly than to do nothing flawlessly.”<br>
— Robert H. Schuller</p>

<p>My 60% “good enough” a month from now will be today’s 80%. In the long term, imperfect work will become more perfect <em>while providing utility to people now.</em> The challenge is to convince myself that providing utility now is worth the unkind words.</p>
<p>I think of the small businesses and private ventures my friends operate, and realize I’m guilty: not of making discouraging comments about their efforts, <strong>but omitting to exhort them.</strong> It’s not enough to not be a jerk — it’s my <em>privilege</em> and responsibility to encourage my peers who are <em>doing</em> things in spite of disparaging comments.</p>
<p>I have a challenge for you: this next week, <strong>pick one person or business who is doing something, and exhort them.</strong> Be their cheerleader. It’s as simple as leaving a thoughtful comment on their social media post or sending a text message. You will make their day. You may not use their product or think it’s tacky, but that’s not the point: encouraging our colleagues is the <em>least</em> we can do to invest in someone’s well-being.</p>
<p>The product — tacky, low production quality or otherwise — will improve with time. So invest a little of your time to feed them with the encouragement they need to stay strong.</p>
<p>It’s a free, easy way to practice empathy — and that’s a life skill we could all stand to perfect.</p>

<p>To become a successful photographer, you just need to keep up what you’re doing, right? Many photographers would give a “yes, but” answer and rightly exhort you to reach further. The common recommendations for advancing in your craft might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shoot more often</li>
<li>Try shooting a new genre</li>
<li>Imitate another photographer’s style</li>
<li>Imitate the path of successful photographers</li>
</ul>
<p>All good advice — except for one: “Imitate the path of successful photographers.”</p>
<p>Wait, should we imitate <em>unsuccessful photographers</em>? Not exactly, that’s not the logical antithesis. Rather, you should concentrate on learning from <em>unsuccessful photographs</em> — <strong>especially those in your own portfolio.</strong></p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mi31TT6DJsU" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>To motivate this, ask yourself the question: what is your objective as a photographer? Why do you spend more time in photography whenever you can?</p>
<ol>
<li>To become the best in your craft?</li>
<li>To fund your photographic endeavors?</li>
<li>To make a full-time living from photography?</li>
<li>To develop a reputation?</li>
</ol>
<p>If your current priority is to become the best in your craft, imitating successful photographers is actually the irrational way to maximize your learning. You <em>will</em> grow and you <em>can</em> be successful in your field this way, but if you want to maximize your time investment, it’s worth cultivating smarter habits that accelerate your learning.</p>
<p>Trying to learn from successes while neglecting failures is a <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/advance-your-travel-photography-by-spotting-these-cognitive-biases/">cognitive bias</a> called Survivorship Bias. It’s a selection bias: the only data-points we see are those which made it past a certain filter that imparts a bias on the data. <a href="https://medium.com/@penguinpress/an-excerpt-from-how-not-to-be-wrong-by-jordan-ellenberg-664e708cfc3d">Abraham Wald played a critical role during World War II</a> when he identified Survivorship Bias in strategies for armoring bombers.</p>
<p>Survivorship Bias is the equivalent of being handed a set of even numbers and making the observation “oh, all these numbers are even!” You’d be absolutely right, but you’ve learned no new information because the even numbers were already <em>selected.</em> What you stated was true, but yielded no new information — like how to <em>generate</em> an even number from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>You learned nothing.</strong></p>
<p>Success stories are an example of selection bias. We only see successes — people, photos, products — that made it past the selection process, and that selection process imparts a non-trivial selection bias on the data-points due to marketing, timing or difficult to replicate effects.</p>
<p>It’s the same in landscape photography: when you spend your time looking at photos you consider successful, you aren’t learning much new information. After all, these photos already meet your criteria of a successful photo, but given a photo that doesn’t quite meet those criteria, you won’t know how to get there beyond starting from scratch with another photo.</p>
<p>So although you <em>can</em> grow from analyzing successful photographs, it’s far from the  <em>best</em> way to spend your learning efforts. You already have a phenomenal data source to facilitate smarter growth: all your photos you <em>didn’t</em> like from a shoot!</p>
<p><strong>Here’s how you can turn those rejected shots into actionable insights to accelerate your growth.</strong></p>
<h2 id="1takenotesinthefield">1. Take notes in the field</h2>
<p>While you scope out locations and dial in camera settings, record your brainwaves. Are you hesitating to pull out the tripod because it’s a pain to put back? What does it feel like to get out for an early dawn shoot? These are important vital signs to track: they will produce accurate, actionable course corrections sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>On my last trip to Oregon, I kept missing twilight because I was anxious about hiking back in the dark. I’ve done this on so many trips without remembering to fix the issue, but this time I finally took notes to that effect. The next day, <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/ultralight-digital-nomad-packing-list/">I purchased a headlamp</a> and was able to hike fearlessly into twilight. Yes, I was stupid not to have done that before — but I suppose being stupid is human nature.</p>
<h2 id="2journalabouttheexperience">2. Journal about the experience</h2>
<p>One or two times a day, journal about the day’s experience. Voice recording is a great way to get these out quickly and capture raw thoughts that congeal into a story. I love recapping everything that happened during the day — random things that made me smile, frustrations and adventures. It may feel like a rehash of taking notes in the field, but I find I tend to see recurring patterns better when I take notes throughout the day and only journal once a day.</p>
<h2 id="3editphotosimmediately">3. Edit photos immediately</h2>
<p>Every day is precious, so the fastest way to improve is to close the feedback loop. I usually edit the prior shoot’s photos at noon and in the evening an hour after the sunrise or sunset shoot. Although the edit I produce is rarely exceptional, I’ll quickly spot issues that I wouldn’t otherwise notice in-camera. But don’t spend too long editing the photos you like!</p>
<h2 id="4critiquerejectedphotos">4. Critique rejected photos</h2>
<p>The key to defeating survivorship bias is to spend most of your time analyzing the photos you <em>don’t</em> like.  You may be tempted to spend your time editing killer shots to perfection, but what about all the other photos you took that didn’t make the cut? Why don’t they work, and what would it take to make them work next time? You don’t want to make the same mistakes again!</p>
<p>So rather than spend all your time focusing on the photos that look great — and are probably just like your existing portfolio — scan only through those that didn’t quite work out.</p>
<h2 id="5holdaretrospective">5. Hold a retrospective</h2>
<p>What caused these failed shots? Did you overlook the composition? Overexpose a shot? Did you spend too long at one spot, only to find it was a bad angle? It’s not enough to pick out <em>why</em> a photo doesn’t work: you need to hypothesize <em>what</em> caused the failure!</p>
<h2 id="6writedownanactionlist">6. Write down an action list</h2>
<p>What are you going to change to squelch these issues? Write down what you are going to do differently for this evening or tomorrow’s shoot so you can close the feedback loop.</p>
<p>“The faintest ink is more powerful than the strongest memory.” Don’t cheat yourself into thinking you’ll remember to address these issues in the field, <strong>write them down.</strong> When you arrive for the shoot, explain to yourself how you are addressing each issue right now.</p>
<h2 id="beatingsurvivorshipbias">Beating survivorship bias</h2>
<p>These steps may seem like busywork, but that’s exactly why we tend to waste so much time in the learning process: we neglect the simple steps that empower us to learn with intentionality. Why take a week to learn passively from your mistakes, instead of taking one day to overcome them?</p>
<p>So take control of your learning! Learning with intentionality is one of the most rewarding ways you can get more for less as a photographer.</p>

Usually I hop to a coffeeshop early in the morning and strategize how I should spend the next week’s time. I spend 20–30 hours a week on Yellowscale-related work: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/nybblr">editing photos</a>, <a href="https://fstoppers.com/profile/133626/articles">writing on Fstoppers</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzW75NP8kpRAC-fXKvpl-Q">shooting vlogs</a>, journaling, SEO things…</p>
<p>My full-time job is as a <a href="https://jonathanleemartin.com">software consultant and instructor</a>. But like many crafts, you rarely have time to invest in your personal assets like you do into client work; when that time does come, it’s rarely a strategic goal. “A contractor’s house is never finished.”</p>
<p>So I had a fun weekend — it finally became a strategic goal to hand-code <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com">Yellowscale.com</a> from scratch. In case web geekery intrigues you:</p>
<ul>
<li>It uses some “new” CSS toys: CSS Grid, Variables, position:sticky and Flexbox. Well, I guess Flexbox isn’t really new, but you’d be surprised how many agencies still use float hacks. 😱</li>
<li>It’s wicked fast thanks to all the usual <a href="https://www.nybblr.com/metrics-metrics-how-we-improved-website-performance-part-2/">web performance tricks</a>, plus some newer ones like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content">preload</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/resource-prioritization">preconnect</a>!  🏎</li>
<li>It passed some accessibility audits — yay ARIA and Lighthouse! 💡</li>
</ul>
<p>Previously, I heavily monkey-patched a <a href="https://html5up.net/">template from HTML5 UP</a>. It served me well, but it feels so nice to code from scratch!</p>
<p>And there are a few new photos too! Have a peek. 👇<br>

But if you want to see a country more like a local — away from tourists — you won’t get to those locations quickly with public transit. After all, if tourists can reach it easily by public transit, they’ll already be there!</p>
<p>So if you want to <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/fstoppers-discover-unique-landscape-photography-spots-before-takeoff/">explore more unique locations</a>, a car rental needs to be on your expense list. As a landscape photographer, this is non-negotiable since I want to find landscapes that most people won’t go to.</p>
<p>I knew nothing about car insurance for <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/19-tips-for-international-travelers-adventurers-edition/">my first trip five years ago</a>, so it was incredibly confusing to understand all the terms and coverages and scenarios. Since then, I’ve become well acquainted with international car rentals, especially in Europe.</p>
<p>Hopefully I can spare you some of that confusion. Here’s everything you need to know about international car rentals.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5K68O1ZSjMc" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<h2 id="bookingthevehicle">Booking the Vehicle</h2>
<p>When you make your reservation, make sure you book with free cancellation and don’t have to enter your credit card number. More details in my post on <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/5-tips-to-save-money-on-international-travel/">five money-saving travel tips</a>, but here’s the TL;DR: <strong>don’t book directly with the rental agency</strong> since they usually ask for a credit card number. You’ll be hard pressed to find a better rate through couponing than just checking rates periodically through Expedia or Priceline. With free cancellation, you’re locking in a rate that’s easy to rebook without penalties.</p>
<p>Be wary of purchasing extras like insurance or an extra driver ahead of time. In particular, I don’t recommend purchasing car insurance through your booking site. I purchased insurance through Expedia for my first trip to Scotland, but the rental company would not honor it and made me purchase their insurance. It was not pleasant to find out at the counter that our car rental price would be double what we booked.</p>
<h2 id="handlingcarinsurance">Handling Car Insurance</h2>
<p>Your personal policy probably doesn’t cover driving overseas, so you’ll need to make alternate insurance arrangements for your trip. In most countries, the rental already include zero-deductible liability: that means if you get in an accident and it’s your fault, liability will fix the other person’s car.</p>
<p>It’s <em>your</em> car that you have to worry about. In some countries, you could be out the entire price of the vehicle, but in most of the countries I’ve traveled to, it’s capped at a high deductible like 5000 EUR. The agency will offer various collision damage waiver tiers to get that deductible down for a (pricey) daily fee.</p>
<p>This is the trickiest part of a car rental, and it goes by many names like Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) or Loss Damage Waiver (LDW). The agency might offer additional insurance that just covers glass, windshield or tire damage. If you can at all help it, <strong>don’t purchase the car rental agency’s insurance.</strong></p>
<h2 id="creditcardcdwbenefits">Credit Card CDW Benefits</h2>
<p>Here’s where a solid credit card comes in. Several of the major credit card companies offer <strong>zero-deductible CDW for free.</strong> While this benefit is normally secondary to your personal insurance, overseas it becomes primary: if you’re at fault for an accident, you’ll have no deductible to pay and the premiums on your personal insurance won’t go up!</p>
<p>That’s incredible when you would otherwise pay an extra $10–$50 per day for the rental agency’s insurance — which <em>still</em> has a deductible. And when you do get in an accident, <strong>you’ll be working with your credit card company</strong> rather than making international calls to the agency’s insurance. It’s hard to overstate how much of a win that is, especially when rental agency customer support tends to be unexceptional.</p>
<p>The difficulty is getting the rental agent to cooperate. I’ve been caught off guard twice in the UK, and the first time I paid double the rate to cover insurance I didn’t actually need because I didn’t have proof of CDW.</p>
<p>Call your credit card company well before your trip to discuss all the terms of their CDW benefit and make sure they cover collision in all countries you’ll be visiting. In particular, only a few credit cards cover collision in Ireland — including mine, which was better than the “Super CDW” you would typically purchase in Ireland.</p>
<h2 id="pickinguptherental">Picking up the Rental</h2>
<p>Sadly, the most frustrating hurdle comes after the red-eye flight: picking up the rental. The agents are often fast-talking salespeople who will be hard to refute without all your mental faculties, so <strong>shortcut the conversation by declining all extras and insurance.</strong></p>
<p>Extras go by many names, so if the price deviates slightly from your booked rate, show the agent your confirmation email and ask why it’s different. If they offer to upgrade you to a fancy vehicle, remember that more expensive vehicles are more expensive to insure — which will slam you if you’re in an accident.</p>
<p>To decline the agency’s insurance, you will need to show proof of your collision damage waiver benefit through your credit card company. For some agencies, this proof must be dated within the last 30 days, so call your credit card company ahead of time to make sure they’ll cover your needs, then ask them to email you proof of CDW a few weeks out from your trip.</p>
<p>If you accept any of the rental company’s insurance, your credit card’s collision benefit will not apply at all for that rental. So if you want to take advantage of your card’s CDW, <strong>you must decline the rental agency’s insurance.</strong></p>
<h2 id="declininginsuranceintheuk">Declining Insurance in the UK</h2>
<p>There’s one confusing exception: in the UK, all rentals are required to include minimum collision insurance. This caught me off guard last year, but unlike my first trip to the UK I had cell service. I called my credit card company, and they explained that so long as I accepted only the minimum insurance and declined any lower deductible options, they would honor any CDW claims.</p>
<p>When you decline, the rental agency will often charge you an “admin fee” that varies from $10–$50. Some of the sketchier agencies will refuse to let you decline their insurance at all, so call ahead and ask what their administrative fee is for waiving collision.</p>
<h2 id="extradriver">Extra Driver</h2>
<p>While you’re on the phone, ask the agency about their rates for an extra driver. Many countries will let a spouse drive for free, but you’ll have to pay extra for a family member or friend. The daily rate for an extra driver could be high enough to sway you to a different rental company altogether.</p>
<p><strong>Never pretend you’ll be the only driver and let your travel companion(s) drive.</strong> If they get in an accident, your credit card’s collision benefit won’t apply. For your credit card’s collision to cover those drivers, their names must appear on the rental agreement.</p>
<h2 id="whereareyouheaded">Where Are You Headed?</h2>
<p>Nothing compares to seeing a country from the driver’s seat, and with a few phone calls you can ensure it’s a cheap option too.</p>
<p>I hope this helps you navigate the confusing domain of car rentals and gives you the courage to take advantage of all that your travel destination has to offer.

With one carry-on sized backpack. It sounds crazy, but every digital nomad packing list I see tends to converge to this utopia, and it’s not surprising why.</p>
<p><strong>No checked bags means:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>No wait to check bags or surprise fees</li>
<li>No lost baggage</li>
<li>You can use budget airlines</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Traveling with one carry-on bag means:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Much less stress during transit and fewer missed layovers</li>
<li>No repacking between hotels and fewer misplaced items</li>
<li>Less stress if your rental car gets smashed</li>
</ol>
<p>In a word, traveling light with one carry-on sized bag is <em>freedom</em>.</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/the-digital-nomad-lifestyle-is-more-about-freedom-and-less-about-travel/">digital nomad</a>, honing your one bag packing list will help turn your dream of traveling around the world indefinitely into reality, and <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/your-map-to-mount-nomad/">now is the time for you to practice</a>.</p>
<p>I didn’t instantly cut down my existence to one bag: <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/stuff-that-hasnt-ruined-my-life/">I’ve spent years</a> learning what I can and can’t get away with.

<p><img src="https://www.yellowscale.com/content/images/2018/03/one-bag-packing-list.jpg" alt="The ultralight digital nomad packing list: one carry-on bag, indefinite travel."></p>
<h2 id="bags">Bags</h2>
<p>Lies. Actually, I… don’t… have… recommendations yet! I’ve traveled for a year with a Lowepro hiking bag — it works, but I’ve not been overly happy with it. So until I find the perfect bag, I’ll hold off on a recommendation.</p>
<p>However, if you aren’t traveling with camera gear, <strong>go with a daypack</strong> instead of a full-blown backpack. I love my 17 liter North Face daypack (discontinued, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/North-Face-Jester-Backpack-Black/dp/B00OS67V6S/?tag=nybblr08-20">here’s a larger one</a> if you’re less lucky at T.J.Maxx), but there’s not anything particularly special about it other than the size. Thanks to a strict packing regime, it holds everything I need for indefinite travel… without camera gear.</p>
<p>Also, don’t forget to pack a <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Outdoor-Products-Packable-Daypack-Black/19487073">foldable nylon daypack</a>. <em>Bag inception.</em> It takes almost no space, and after your flight you can shove clothes and toiletries in it so your main bag sheds some weight.</p>
<h2 id="clothes">Clothes</h2>
<p>I’ve spent a few years honing my ultralight wardrobe, and a few characteristics apply to everything. First, <strong>eliminate any clothing that is 100% cotton.</strong> This is a non-negotiable: you won’t exactly wash your clothes everyday, and cotton will be unpleasant during use, smell awful after use, and turn to rock once you get around to washing it. Why pack 10 cotton tees that fit so-so and are miserable in hot weather, instead of owning 3 shirts that look great and are made of materials that perform well in inclement weather?</p>
<p>Your wardrobe should be primarily made of nature’s miracle fabric, <strong>merino wool.</strong> It resists odors, keeps you cool in the heat and warm in the cold, and air dries without turning to rock. Even when I’m not traveling, merino wool is pretty much the only fabric I own. Yes, it’s pricey — but you only need 2–3 of most items, and you won’t purchase them often. It’s a small price to pay for legendary comfort and not smelling like a vagabond.</p>
<p><strong>I follow the three-layer system:</strong> a merino wool base layer, a down jacket for the mid layer and a rain jacket for the outer layer. Whether I’m headed for 80 degrees or 20 degrees, I’m covered!</p>
<p>Here’s the entire clothing list:</p>
<h3 id="shirts">Shirts</h3>
<p><strong>3 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Icebreaker-Everyday-Short-Sleeve-Crewe/dp/B00AF6ZV4O/?tag=nybblr08-20">Icebreaker merino wool shirts</a></strong> for the base layer: a short sleeve and long sleeve will cover a wide range of temperatures. Merino wool comes in <a href="https://www.onebagger.com/merino-wool-guide/">a lot of grades</a> and weights, so it’s not a place to skimp. Short sleeves are generally thin and come in a weight of 150 g/m2 (grams per square meter), while long sleeves are a thicker 200 g/m2. I travel with 3 variations:</p>
<ol>
<li>A dressy black <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Icebreaker-Merino-Anatomica-Sleeve-Monsoon/dp/B01GXGN6HI/?tag=nybblr08-20">Icebreaker Anatomica V-neck</a>, with a fabric weight of 150 g/m2. It’s well fitted, so it looks great solo or layered under anything. Lately these are getting hard to find at less than retail price, so you might have to do some googling if you can’t find a color and size you like. If V-necks aren’t your thing, I own a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072KVDXMW/?tag=nybblr08-20">crew version as well</a> that served me well.</li>
<li>A thicker <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AF5ISPO/?tag=nybblr08-20">Icebreaker Oasis Crewe</a>, which comes in 200 g/m2. It seems discontinued, but there’s a newer lookalike with the same specs, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Icebreaker-Everyday-Short-Sleeve-Crewe/dp/B00AF6ZV4O/?tag=nybblr08-20">Icebreaker Everyday Crewe</a>. The crew is slightly less fitted than the Anatomica lineup, but look greats and has seen the most use — even in warmer climates.</li>
<li>A long sleeve <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Icebreaker-Merino-Everyday-Sleeve-Crewe/dp/B00AF6ZKL8/?tag=nybblr08-20">Icebreaker Everyday Long Sleeve Tee</a> in 200 g/m2. I use it in two extremes: when it’s below 30 degrees outside, or when it’s hot and sunny. It sounds counterintuitive, but the long sleeves keep the heat off you while wicking away sweat, so it’s often more comfortable than a short sleeve and wearing sunscreen.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="downjacket">Down Jacket</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Patagonia-Mens-Down-Sweater-Hoodie/dp/B073RP8KSK/?tag=nybblr08-20">Patagonia down jacket</a></strong>. You can’t beat a down jacket for weight to warmth ratio, but like merino wool, a down jacket isn’t just for the frozen fjords: it acts as an insulator in moderate temperatures. I frequently wear a merino base layer and down jacket in 50 degree weather and don’t notice the warmth.</p>
<p>Down jackets don’t have to break the bank: before upgrading to my Patagonia down jacket, I used a $50 REI Coop jacket that still does a great job. In fact, it fits more easily in my camera bag.</p>
<h3 id="rainjacket">Rain Jacket</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Outdoor-Research-Helium-Jacket-Black/dp/B00ELMXNG6/?tag=nybblr08-20">Outdoor Research Helium HD rain jacket</a></strong>. The outer layer doesn’t see constant use like the base and mid layers, but it’s indispensable for any traveler. A DWR-treated down jacket is not enough: the third layer is meant to provide <em>real</em> wind and water protection. You should always have a rain jacket handy, so I opted for the best ultralight option I could find. Fair disclosure: because I use rain jackets infrequently, I haven’t put my HD under too much stress, but so far it’s been a huge upgrade from my clammy North Face Venture jacket.</p>
<p>If you are willing to forego a few features, go for “the” ultralight champion: the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Outdoor-Research-Helium-Jacket-Pewter/dp/B005BV8834/?tag=nybblr08-20">Outdoor Research Helium II rain jacket</a>. This is the #1 recommendation in ultralight jackets, and it’s cheaper than the HD! I went with the HD for one reason: I need pockets. Otherwise, the Helium II would have been my clear choice.</p>
<h3 id="socks">Socks</h3>
<p><strong>2–3 pairs of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Darn-Tough-Vermont-Cushion-X-Large/dp/B008RSF3OU/?tag=nybblr08-20">Darn Tough merino wool socks</a></strong>. There’s nothing worse than rotten smelling socks after a day of hiking. These socks are worth every dollar — they keep the feet comfortable in all climates, have lots of cushion, resist odor, and are pretty easy to hand-wash. I’ve worn the same 2 pairs every day for 3 years.</p>
<p>I have 2 pairs of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Darn-Tough-Vermont-Cushion-X-Large/dp/B008RSF3OU/?tag=nybblr08-20">Darn Tough’s 1/4 style</a>, which are my favorite to wear, and for shorts weather I have 2 pairs of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Darn-Tough-No-Show-Cushion-Athletic/dp/B00F0NCJNS/?tag=nybblr08-20">Darn Tough No Shows</a>. Supposedly Darn Tough will replace the sock if it gets a hole, but I haven’t yet needed to take advantage of that.</p>
<h3 id="leggings">Leggings</h3>
<p><strong>1 pair of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AFOPNBC/?tag=nybblr08-20">Icebreaker Oasis merino wool leggings</a></strong> to go under your jeans in sub 30 degree weather. With some luck, sometimes you can snag a pair out of season for $20 at a T.J.Maxx.</p>
<h3 id="jeans">Jeans</h3>
<p><strong>1 pair of jeans with &gt; 20% polyester</strong>. Jeans are the bane of my existence, and most pairs I buy end up with the dreaded hole-in-crotch. My favorite pair of jeans finally ripped a week ago, but it’s the <em>only</em> pair I’ve worn for 3 years. The secret? <strong>Polyester.</strong> Polyester mix jeans are incredibly durable, insanely light, comfortable and surprisingly stylish even on business trips. They hold their shape well and dry out quickly.</p>
<p>If you have some time, keep an eye on your local department stores and you may find a pair of $20 with patience. Whatever you do, don’t travel with cotton jeans — your everything thanks you.</p>
<p>Now that my faithful pair has finally ripped, I’m considering investing in some “true” travel pants, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/prAna-30-Inch-Inseam-Charcoal-inseam/dp/B006QM6XM0/?tag=nybblr08-20">prAna Brion pants</a> are at the top of my list. These are the final word in ultralight durability thanks to the mostly nylon construction, and they’re DWR-treated. The best part? They’re really affordable compared to the typical rate for specialty hiking jeans. I’m just waiting to find them locally to check the fit and look.</p>
<h3 id="underwear">Underwear</h3>
<p><strong>3 pairs of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ExOfficio-Give-N-Go-Boxer-Brief-Medium/dp/B001M0MMZS/?tag=nybblr08-20">ExOfficio Boxer Briefs</a></strong>. Yep, time for fancy underwear. Anything that isn’t 100% cotton will do, but polyester is the way to go since you have to sink wash them every (other?) day anyway. My pairs pilled a bit when I first got them, but haven’t gotten any worse after 2 years of constant use.</p>
<p>A word of warning: lately ExOfficio seems to be having quality assurance issues. My brother just got the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ExOfficio-Give-N-Go-Sport-Medium-Phantom/dp/B00MOBSSUC/?tag=nybblr08-20">ExOfficio Sport Boxer Briefs</a> and it started sticking to itself and pilling like crazy after one sink-wash — disappointing to say the least. The original ExOfficio Boxer Briefs aren’t as comfortable for hiking, so the Sport was on my upgrade list, but I think I’ll wait till quality control gets their act together.</p>
<h3 id="shoes">Shoes</h3>
<p><strong>1 pair of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Merrell-Mens-Gore-Tex-Hiking-Chocolate/dp/B001FYVMCA/?tag=nybblr08-20">waterproof Merrell Gore-Tex hiking shoes</a></strong>. I’m not sold on the look, but hiking shoes are definitely my go-to travel shoes for city trekking and hiking in the Lake District fells.</p>
<h2 id="tech">Tech</h2>
<h3 id="smartphone">Smartphone</h3>
<p><strong>Any smartphone</strong> except an iPhone Plus or Samsung Galaxy. A giant phone screen will be your enemy as a nomad: many of the travel jeans don’t have a large enough pocket, and given the amount of walking and hiking you’ll be doing, a large screen will either get bent or smashed.</p>
<h3 id="laptop">Laptop</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MNYF2LL-MacBook-Processor-Version/dp/B072QGG3V7/?tag=nybblr08-20">12” MacBook</a></strong> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Retina-MPXV2LL-Version/dp/B071WLXKB3/?tag=nybblr08-20">13” MacBook Pro</a>. Lugging around a 15” brick is out of the question. I’ve switched between the 13” and 12” over the last few years, and I’m torn: the 12” is the last word on portability and plenty powerful for everything <em>except</em> editing photos. If I can find a backpack I like and cut down the weight of my camera gear, I’ll probably go back to the 13-incher. C’mon Apple, work your magic!</p>
<h3 id="headlamp">Headlamp</h3>
<p><strong>Hiking headlamp like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-Diamond-Spot-Headlamp-Size/dp/B06W54SBSL/?tag=nybblr08-20">Black Diamond Spot</a></strong>. I prefer a USB rechargeable one so I don’t need to carry backup batteries (more weight and space), but haven’t yet tested out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-Diamond-Revolt-Headlamp-Denim/dp/B01LE9Z6PO/?tag=nybblr08-20">Black Diamond ReVolt</a>.</p>
<h3 id="adapters">Adapters</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Type-C-HDMI-Multiport-Adapter/dp/B01LYJQ5ZD/?tag=nybblr08-20">Amazon Basics USB-C adapter</a></strong>. Yeah, you can pay 50% more for Apple’s, but from the reviews it seems notoriously glitchy. On the off-chance my Amazon Basics version goes bad, I also tote the teeny tiny <a href="https://www.amazon.com/nonda-Adapter-Aluminum-Indicator-Macbook/dp/B015Z7XE0A/?tag=nybblr08-20">nonda USB-C to USB 3.0</a> adapter.</p>
<h3 id="plugadapters">Plug Adapters</h3>
<p><strong>2 OREI plug adapters</strong> for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DTRHB2G/?tag=nybblr08-20">mainland Europe</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/OREI-Grounded-Universal-Adapter-Singapore/dp/B004SCSV2U/?tag=nybblr08-20">the UK</a>. Keep in mind that these plugs do <strong>not</strong> convert the voltage, so check all your electronics to make sure they can operate on the country’s power grid. Most smartphones, laptops and camera gear work with 240V out of the box, but always double check lest you fry your gear and hotel room.</p>
<p>As I expand my list of countries I may consider a universal plug adapter, but the dedicated plugs are so cheap, light, compact and expendable that I don’t see any reason to purchase a bulky universal adapter.</p>
<h3 id="earbuds">Earbuds</h3>
<p><strong>OEM Apple earbuds</strong>. Hard to lose, cheap to replace, but useless on flights. Bulky headphones are out of the question, but I’m eyeing these noise-blocking earbuds: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00D429Y12/?tag=nybblr08-20">Bose QuietComfort 20i</a>. I’m not ready to drop a few hundred bucks on earbuds, but if I decide to care about audio and noise cancellation, these will be first on my wishlist.</p>
<h3 id="backupdrive">Backup Drive</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Portable-External-Photography-STDR2000100/dp/B00FRHTTIU/?tag=nybblr08-20">Seagate 2TB Slim External Hard Drive</a></strong>. I back up my photos daily for a total of three copies: originals on my CompactFlash cards, imported DNGs on my laptop, and DNG copies on my the backup drive.</p>
<p>In case my backpack is stolen, I keep backup devices in at least two locations. In transit, I keep CF cards in my pocket and the backup drive in my backpack. Since rear-end collisions are common, I recommend storing your gear in the rear passenger seat instead of the trunk.</p>
<h3 id="carcharger">Car Charger</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-PowerDrive-iPhone-Galaxy/dp/B00VH84L5E/?tag=nybblr08-20">Anker Dual USB car charger</a></strong>. As a digital nomad, it seems impossible to live without a smartphone — maps, bookings, offline translations — so a dead phone triggers my panic button. <strong>Never cheap out on chargers:</strong> a poor converter will damage your pricey equipment.</p>
<h2 id="photographygear">Photography Gear</h2>
<h3 id="camerabody">Camera Body</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Frame-Full-HD-Digital-Camera/dp/B007FGYZFI/?tag=nybblr08-20">Canon 5D Mark III</a></strong>. Someday I’ll probably switch to a mirrorless like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Full-frame-Mirrorless-Interchangeable-Lens-ILCE7M3K/dp/B07B45D8WV/?tag=nybblr08-20">Sony a7 III</a>, but till then I’ll be shooting on my faithful 5D.</p>
<h3 id="cameralens">Camera Lens</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-EF-16-35mm-USM-Lens/dp/B00K8942SO/?tag=nybblr08-20">Canon 16–35mm f/4 L lens</a></strong> with hood. I used the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-24-105mm-USM-Zoom-Lens/dp/B000B84KAW/?tag=nybblr08-20">24–105mm</a> for the last 5 years, but it will stay at home now since <a href="https://fstoppers.com/originals/how-fit-your-gear-and-clothes-one-bag-travel-indefinitely-226731">I only travel with one lens</a>.</p>
<h3 id="memorycards">Memory Cards</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-Professional-1066x-CompactFlash-LCF32GCRBNA10662/dp/B00IQCRTQ2/?tag=nybblr08-20">Lexar 1066x CompactFlash cards</a></strong>. Your memory cards need to be rock-solid reliable after thousands of miles traveled and dollars spent. And with <a href="https://www.magiclantern.fm/">Magic Lantern</a>, these cards are fast enough to <a href="https://vimeo.com/139290481">shoot gorgeous RAW footage</a>. Still, I’m looking forward to a mirrorless camera so I can just use cheaper SD cards.</p>
<h3 id="cardreader">Card Reader</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-Professional-USB-Dual-Slot-Reader/dp/B00WBK03OU/?tag=nybblr08-20">Lexar CompactFlash card reader</a></strong>. Cheap readers can corrupt CF cards, so it’s worth spending a few extra dollars for a reputable one.</p>
<h3 id="camerabattery">Camera Battery</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-9486B002-Battery-Pack-LP-E6N/dp/B00NI3CSIS/?tag=nybblr08-20">1 extra battery</a></strong>. The 5D’s impressive battery life usually lasts a couple days, but more than once I’ve forgotten to charge it.</p>
<h3 id="cplfilter">CPL Filter</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kaesemann-Circular-Polarizer-Multi-Resistant-Coating/dp/B00OK6YSAS/?tag=nybblr08-20">B+W CPL filter</a></strong>. I have the previous generation, but B+W recently released an upgraded polarizer that cuts out less light and is cheaper.</p>
<h3 id="ndfilter">ND Filter</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/1-8-64x-Multi-Resistant-Coating-Camera-66-1089230/dp/B01MRU56X0/?tag=nybblr08-20">B+W 6-stop ND filter</a></strong>. I own a 10-stop filter as well, but since it’s rarely called for I have stopped packing it altogether.</p>
<h3 id="tripod">Tripod</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sirui-T2205X-Tripod-Section-Height/dp/B004WY7W42/?tag=nybblr08-20">Sirui T-2205X Carbon Fiber Tripod</a></strong>. Easily fits in my carry-on backpack. I’ve been through three tripods, and this one strikes the perfect balance between stability and ultralight portability. And the twist locks are fantastic!</p>
<h3 id="ballhead">Ball Head</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sirui-K-20X-Ball-Head-Black/dp/B004QC3COO/?tag=nybblr08-20">Sirui K-20x Ball Head</a></strong>. Arca-style, rock solid, medium weight ball head that won’t break your camera or the bank.</p>
<h3 id="camerastraps">Camera Straps</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.peakdesign.com/product/straps/leash?acc=953">Peak Design Leash camera straps</a></strong> (in testing). After hating on some cheap shoulder straps, I briefly returned to Canon’s neck strap, but nowadays I’m testing out Peak Design’s straps. The ultralight Leash straps seem to the strike the perfect balance for nomad friendliness. Keep an eye open for updates and reviews!</p>
<h3 id="microfibercloths">Microfiber Cloths</h3>
<p><strong>Two microfiber cloths</strong>. Just steal them from an Apple fanboy.</p>
<h3 id="gloves">Gloves</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://us.photographygloves.com/products/vallerret-photography-glove-markhof-pro-model">Vallerret fingerless merino wool gloves</a></strong>. Fingers are the first thing to freeze in landscape photography, so I consider these part of my photography kit.</p>
<h2 id="toiletries">Toiletries</h2>
<p>The trick to ultralight packing isn’t to make everything smaller, but to figure out what you don’t need to bring in the first place! So nowadays <strong>I travel with almost no toiletries</strong> — I only carry what I couldn’t live without. Maybe it sounds anti-climatic, but disposable goods are the easiest to pick up and the most irritating to transport.</p>
<p>No special brands here, it’s all disposable anyway. At all costs, avoid lots of little plastic bottles — if it can go in a plastic bag, do it:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 regular toothbrush. Nope, it’s not even the cute fold-up one from Walmart’s travel section.</li>
<li>1 regular (full size) deodorant. The little ones never last long enough and don’t come in any scent I can stand. Why do deodorant sticks have to be so stupidly bulky?</li>
<li>2 itty bitty toothpaste tubes. Why can’t they make a toothpaste tube that’s 3 oz?</li>
<li>TSA-friendly sick kit: some plastic bags with ibuprofen, loratadine and occasionally a <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Rice-Sock">homemade rice bag</a> cover a host of minor ailments.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do have one trick for the guys who want to maintain their hairstyle. Opt for a really thick hair wax or cement instead of gel, and the TSA won’t count it against your quota of liquids. For the last couple years, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Layrite-Cement-Matte-Hair-Clay/dp/B00UM4ZDCY/?tag=nybblr08-20">Layrite Cement Hair Clay</a> has been my favorite. Not only does it take precious little wax to style, but you can scoop a palmful into a few makeup jars and be set for months at a time.</p>
<h2 id="whewthatseverything">Whew, that’s everything!</h2>
<p>Hopefully you learned a few tricks for your own ultralight packing list. Obviously this packing list is tailored specifically to my needs as a male digital nomad and landscape photographer.</p>
<p>With all this geekery comes an exhortation: never let unknowns — least of all, ideal packing — stop you from traveling. Don’t wait until you have the “perfect” packing setup before seeing the world, because <strong>you will never reach perfection.</strong> However, you will approach perfection much faster through practice and journaling what worked well and what didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>So pack your bag and go see the world!</strong></p>

For those who love to travel, a couple weeks off is just enough to torture your wanderlust. So if you’re in a good spot financially, you might consider a more drastic option: <strong>a travel sabbatical.</strong></p>
<p>It’s much less common in the US, but when treated like an investment, the travel sabbatical is a powerful option to recharge, invest in your career and reevaluate how you want to spend your time and money.</p>
<p>However, when I mention a travel sabbatical to burned-out colleagues, the response is usually a variation of “Are you kidding? I can’t afford that, and I’d be quitting my job. All so I can spend time lazing at a beach.”</p>
<p>I promise my rebuttal isn’t snarky, because there is truth in what they say: the average American lives beyond their means and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2017/11/18/a-foolish-take-heres-how-much-debt-the-average-us-household-owes/107651700/">carries an average debt of $137k</a>. Payments on new cars, mortgages, credit card debt, student loans — in the words of Dave Ramsey, we’re swimming in debt so we can “buy things we don’t need with money we don’t have to impress people we don’t like.”</p>
<p>The solution to our debt addiction: <strong>we are work martyrs,</strong> and our life becomes synonymous with our work. No wonder we feel dizzy at the thought of quitting a job!</p>

<p>The dynamic duo <a href="https://fstoppers.com/travel/feeling-burned-out-your-day-job-consider-taking-travel-sabbatical-258761">Vagabrothers</a> have some great insights into how you should approach a sabbatical, but the intro especially resonates with me because it highlights the importance of introspection. We’re heavily influenced by our peers, so we tend to take these assumptions for granted:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must own a car</li>
<li>You must own a house</li>
<li>You need a “fulfilling” career to sustain you till retirement</li>
<li>You should postpone serious travel till retirement</li>
<li>You will quit your job around 65 to retire</li>
</ul>
<p>This is definitely the tried-and-true way to live, but it’s not the one-true-way to live, nor is it the healthiest. <strong>You have a choice.</strong> It sounds trivial, but we have chained ourselves to how everyone around us lives — and we hold the key. You aren’t less of a person if you choose to take control of your time and finances.</p>
<p>In fact, I commend you. The “American Dream” isn’t all that dreamy when you tally up the debts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/01/americans-borrow-record-amounts-for-autos-even-as-interest-rates-rise.html">$31k average debt for car</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thebalance.com/average-monthly-mortgage-payment-4154282">$1k median monthly mortgage payment</a>.</li>
<li>A “fulfilling career” tends to be synonymous with workaholism.</li>
<li>Retirement is becoming an illusion as the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-10/working-past-70-americans-can-t-seem-to-retire">average retirement age goes up</a>.</li>
<li>At retirement, we are less physically able to enjoy travel and less inclined to make lifestyle changes to facilitate it.</li>
<li>The most disturbing debt: postponing travel till the tail-end of our lives robs us of the enrichment it contributes to our lives now.</li>
</ul>
<p>Life doesn’t have to happen in an office from 9 to 5, 48+ weeks per year from age 20 to 70. But you need to put your time and money into your priorities and ruthlessly evaluate anything that doesn’t align with them.</p>
<h2 id="evaluateasabbatical">Evaluate a sabbatical</h2>
<p>Assuming you are able to take a sabbatical, it’s time to ask if you are going for the right reasons and with the right expectations. We’re subject to a myriad of <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/advance-your-travel-photography-by-spotting-these-cognitive-biases/">cognitive biases that prevent us from reasoning correctly</a>, and the antidote is usually some introspection. So pull out a notebook and ask yourself:</p>
<p><strong>1. Why do you want to take a travel sabbatical?</strong> Like most introspective questions, the answer seems obvious until you articulate it. Do you want to see the world? Spend time recharging? Escape some rough situations at work? Save money — yes really, <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/want-to-travel-full-time-your-us-tax-return-might-fund-a-year-off-the-grid/">check out the FEIE</a>. Are there any options besides a sabbatical that would provide similar outcomes?</p>
<p><strong>2. What do you expect to get out of the sabbatical?</strong> You probably don’t want to just spend 6 months chilling at a beach (or maybe you do). But more likely you feel burned out <em>and</em> have other interests or career paths you want to invest in. You want to “change your life,” and that won’t happen with a 9 to 5.</p>
<p>This sabbatical is about personal growth: it’s not vacation, <strong>it’s an investment.</strong> So get some rest, but treat the sabbatical like your new full-time job. Be intentional so you can tie expenditures to measurable outcomes — there’s nothing worse than feeling aimless when you pay the hotel bills, and it’s hard to sell others on your sabbatical if you haven’t sold yourself on its tangible value.</p>
<p><strong>3. How do you want to spend your time during the sabbatical?</strong> Start building a sample itinerary and a rough breakdown of how you will spend your days. Are you going to shoot during the mornings and do a few hours of freelance writing in the afternoon? You don’t have to stick with the itinerary, but you should set realistic expectations to reference.</p>
<p><strong>4. What would make the sabbatical a “success”?</strong> Kickstarting a new career? Building up a photography portfolio? Evaluating an overseas move? Recharging your creativity? It’s a hard question to answer if you are approaching a sabbatical as an extended vacation, but even then, you should spend time qualifying what an effective vacation would do.</p>
<p><strong>5. What are you giving up?</strong> This shouldn’t come too hard since it’s the reason so few people consider a sabbatical in the first place. Before you rush to whip up a spreadsheet, list out the tangible <em>and</em> intangible things you are giving up, like job security, a decorated house and game nights with friends. There’s more at stake than just your paycheck.</p>
<p>Next, pull out a spreadsheet and tally up your current monthly expenses versus income. How would this change during a sabbatical? You’ll forfeit a full-time salary, but there’s a host of expenses that you can eliminate to compensate for the new ones you’d take on to travel. Check the numbers from an overseas vacation and use them as a guide.</p>
<p>After some number crunching, you should arrive at two numbers: your current monthly balance of expenditures to salary, and an estimated balance during the sabbatical. The difference between these two is your <strong>opportunity cost.</strong></p>
<p>This is where you put a tangible money value on that travel time. During a 6-month sabbatical, you may be able to average a similar monthly cost to your current costs, but you are also forfeiting pay. The opportunity cost analysis is a more realistic way to account for this loss.</p>
<p><strong>6. What obstacles do you need to start removing now?</strong></p>
<p>The opportunity cost analysis can be sobering, but I find it encouraging because it turns what was previously an unquantified impossibility into an achievable reality. Your next step is to start formulating action steps that will position you for a sabbatical. That might mean:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/stuff-that-hasnt-ruined-my-life/">Selling hordes of clutter</a>.</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/your-map-to-mount-nomad/">Adopting the digital nomad lifestyle</a>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Downsizing expenditures.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tackling your debts.</strong> I highly recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Total-Money-Makeover-Classic-Financial/dp/1595555277/?tag=nybblr08-20">The Total Money Makeover</a> by Dave Ramsey. Few things are as satisfying as the peace and freedom that comes with being debt-free!</li>
</ul>
<p>As a digital nomad, I’ve tried to position myself so that travel, photography and my software career are not in opposition, but fuel each other. It’s taken several years to get here, and I’m still a long ways off — but the journey alone has enhanced my life and enabled me to pursue opportunities I would never have imagined.</p>
<p>So even if you decide not to take a sabbatical down the road, you’ll be better off for your intentionality.</p>
<h2 id="ignorethepassiveaggressivehints">Ignore the passive aggressive hints</h2>
<p>There will always be peers who will express their disapproval: either they will be forthright, or they will fiddle with your emotional resolve through <a href="https://www.coachingpositiveperformance.com/8-examples-passive-aggressive-behaviour/">passive aggressive hints</a>. They will think you’re strange, slacking off, lazy, or all the above. But the reality is <em>you are working harder</em> to take control of your career, your time and your money.</p>
<p>Take counsel from those who have demonstrated their commitment to your well-being in the past, but ignore the naysayers who are in debt, buying expensive items they can’t afford, spending all their time working for companies that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/u-s-workers-vacation-time/index.html">don’t compensate employees more for loyalty</a>.</p>
<p><strong>You are working towards an investment</strong> — not a vacation — that is worth more to you than what you leave behind. I for one am cheering you on!</p>

It was also one of the most frustrating trips I’ve taken — but I learned so much about landscape photography, particularly about shooting with only an ultra-wide angle lens: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-EF-16-35mm-USM-Lens/dp/B00K8942SO/?tag=nybblr08-20">Canon’s 16–35mm f/4 lens</a>.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I made tons of mistakes, but learned more in 15 days than my last few trips combined. Traveling with just an ultra wide-angle lens is a powerful way to improve your landscape photography, especially your compositions.</p>

<p>A couple weeks ago, someone asked me what it meant to be a digital nomad. I rattled off a quick definition: <strong>Digital nomads are people who leverage technology to work from anywhere.</strong> They followed up with: “Why did <em>you</em> become a digital nomad?”</p>
<p>I started my usual response: that I loved to travel, that I didn’t want to be tied down, that stuff isn’t important to me. But even as I answered, I felt that didn’t cut it for my current circumstances — I haven’t traveled at all since last year, I have an apartment in Atlanta, and like most apartment tenants I own furniture and a few dishes.</p>
<p>So why am I a digital nomad? What does it mean to be a digital nomad?</p>
<p>When I look at my apartment, <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/ultralight-digital-nomad-packing-list/">I own very little</a>. The only furniture I own is a desk, mattress and IKEA bookshelf. My entire wardrobe fits in a couple IKEA baskets (super great hack by the way, dressers are overrated). It didn’t happen overnight: <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/your-map-to-mount-nomad/">I’ve been consolidating, selling and giving away for years</a>.</p>
<p>Is owning very little the recipe for being a digital nomad? It certainly seems like a crucial ingredient, but somehow it doesn’t feel like the hallmark.</p>
<p>I was feeling a bit nostalgic, so I hopped into my journal to do some trip planning. I started outlining how I want to spend a month in Norway, then (finally) see Iceland and do car camping. Perhaps I could see southern New Zealand’s Alps too.</p>
<p>That’s when it made sense: the reason I can make outlandish plans and expect to turn them into reality is <em>because</em> I’m a digital nomad. Owning as little as possible empowers me to drop everything with zero ties or regrets to taint the joys.</p>
<p><strong>Being a digital nomad is about safeguarding your freedom to pursue the lifestyle of your choice with as few impediments as possible, and then pursuing that lifestyle with deliberation and intentionality.</strong></p>
<p>I’m reading an inspiring article about the experience <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2138841/how-live-out-your-car">living out of a car</a>. I had considered a travel trailer before, but hadn’t sold myself on the idea of towing my life everywhere I go. Retrofitting an SUV seems like a more reasonable option to start, but the limited space borders on extreme even for me. But my favorite takeaway from the post is this gem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When you don’t own many things, you don’t worry about many things.”<br>
—Andy Cochrane</p>
</blockquote>
<p>☝️ That one sentence sums up one of the greatest freedoms of being a digital nomad. You won’t be on the road 100% of the time (I’m nowhere near). But no matter where you are, you won’t have anything stopping you from pursuing your priorities.</p>
<p>So <em>hallo</em> Norway, <em>halló</em> Iceland, and hello New Zealand. There’s no-thing stopping me.</p>
