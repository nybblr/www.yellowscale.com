<p><a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/how-to-lead-the-eye-with-composition-shapes-and-lighting/">A few vlogs ago</a>, we broke down three ingredients of effective landscape photography:</p>
<ol>
<li>Composition</li>
<li>Shapes</li>
<li>Lighting</li>
</ol>
<p>By weaving these three elements together, we can reveal subjects spread throughout the image only as the viewer wanders through the landscape. After editing a shot for too long, it can be difficult to assess the image objectively ‚Äî one way to reset your artistic senses is to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woq3rZZsC1g">edit the image upside down</a>.</p>
<p>This week, we return to critiquing some images to break down why some images are effective at stalling the viewer‚Äôs interest. In particular, panoramas turn out to be a surprisingly difficult format to execute well and secure the viewer‚Äôs attention.</p>
<p>Whenever one element ‚Äî composition, shapes or lighting ‚Äî is missing, it‚Äôs difficult to compensate with the other two. Without enough subjects in the composition, there‚Äôs nothing for the shapes to connect, and even a perfect composition won‚Äôt mask flat lighting.</p>
<p>As you browse through your portfolio, use this critiquing process as an opportunity to <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/survivorship-bias-why-success-teaches-us-nothing/">turn photos that didn‚Äôt work out</a> into learning material so that next time, you can be more intentional.

<p>What is the first image that came to mind? A graphic design style? An interior? An empty, bleak, white-washed room?</p>
<p>Or did it make you think of a lifestyle?</p>
<h2 id="ataleoftwohouses">A Tale of Two Houses</h2>
<p>Like most of our friends and neighbors, my parents had a lot of stuff. Closets, attics, garages, kitchen cabinets‚Ä¶ filled to the brim with things that we rarely used and hoped we wouldn‚Äôt need. That stuff provided a sense of security and comfort for my parents.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm a bit contrarian: all that unused, uncatalogued stuff gave me anxiety. Closed closet doors made me want to pour over their contents to dispel their hidden mysteries. We responded differently to having lots of stuff, but my family had one universal frustration: <strong>the things we did love were drowned out by what we didn‚Äôt.</strong></p>
<p>When we entertained guests, we would spend a couple days cleaning, storing and tossing ‚Äî but with a surplus of knick-knacks, we always had the inevitable temptation to display what we loved alongside mediocre pieces. It wasn‚Äôt that we lacked stunning pieces, but that they became diluted by less stunning items that we displayed for sheer need.</p>
<p>It was a bit like merging a fine art portfolio with Instagram selfies.</p>
<p>Last week, my brother Josh moved into his new place. I have to admit, for someone who professes to care little for stuff, I‚Äôm a little envious. He has a beautiful space to work from, and with his interior design skills he could turn the space into a gallery (and sell my <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/">fine art photography</a>) or feature it on Houzz.</p>
<p>He owns very little. The space is huge and will remain empty for some time, but the few things he owns display a caliber of taste that fills up the space.</p>
<p>With Josh moved out, I resolved on my drive back to redouble my efforts to get rid of anything superfluous, especially larger furniture that would <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/the-digital-nomad-lifestyle-is-more-about-freedom-and-less-about-travel/">give me a moment‚Äôs hesitation</a>. I felt inspired to clean things up a bit, only to find:</p>
<ul>
<li>Now that I have fewer things, it feels empty.</li>
<li>The interior designer in me wants to turn my apartment into an art canvas.</li>
<li>The bathroom screams for a makeover.</li>
<li>I feel the need to fill the space up.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a space is too empty, I feel a bit lonely. When I own too much stuff, I feel attached and anxious about it holding me down. <em>The conflict that stirs within!</em> What shall I do?</p>
<h2 id="theminimalistethos">The Minimalist Ethos</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúSurround yourself with (a few) things you love.‚Äù<br>
‚ÄîMe?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Minimalism doesn‚Äôt mean owning nothing. Minimalism is an ethos: it means having nothing superfluous, and often that means choosing a few quality things over quantity. Minimalism can be framed in the negative: ‚ÄúRemove everything that is superfluous.‚Äù But sometimes I find it a bit contrary to the purpose of minimalism. So I start from the positive: ‚ÄúBe intentional about what you add: only add what brings exceptional value.‚Äù</p>
<p>What do I love, and what things make me happier? I have a handful of exceptional things, some that could be considered superfluous:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accent lighting. As a photographer, light strongly affects my mood.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/ultralight-digital-nomad-packing-list/">Travel clothes</a>, and some dressier winter wear that I probably wouldn‚Äôt travel with like a scarf and sweater from Ireland.</li>
<li>A few succulents, like lavender and ferns, that remind of my favorite places in the world.</li>
<li>Candles and soaps. Yes guys, roll your eyes ‚Äî of the five senses, the sense of smell creates the strongest ties to memories and has the strongest recall. I have a candle that smells like the Scottish Highlands and a soap like ferns in the Pacific Northwest. But ironically, my strongest memory trigger to date is a deodorant I used (and hated) while traveling non-stop for three months.</li>
<li>A few small but unique knick-knacks that carry dual value.</li>
<li>A chair that reminds me of the Alps, and a smaller desk chair that reminds me of Norway.</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of these items would be considered superfluous: extra lighting, plants and other decor accents. But ‚Äúsuperfluous‚Äù implies they bring no value, when in fact they bring exceptional value to me by making my space a place I enjoy living in ‚Äî but without holding me down.</p>
<p>Every posession you own will have a chance to posess you. Minimalism asks you to be <em>intentional</em> about every item you introduce to your life. Everything has a cost, <em>so make each one count.</em></p>

It usually includes the use of composition, shapes and lighting to encourage a viewer to rove the image in a fashion that tells a story.</p>
<p>The ‚Äúbeats‚Äù of a plot line don‚Äôt come all at once: they are spaced throughout the story to hold the viewer‚Äôs interest. And like any good story, the beats of a captivating landscape image aren‚Äôt condensed into one region of the photo.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pn8Sg1cZAGs" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Stories are hard to tell with a still image, but we can imitate a few key components of effective storytelling by slowly revealing new details and subtleties as the viewer dwells on it. It starts with composition, shapes and lighting: these aspects of an image tell a story and communicate a mood by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintaining the viewer‚Äôs interest</li>
<li>Drawing attention to the important elements</li>
<li>Helping the viewer skip past the unimportant regions</li>
</ul>
<p>To drive home these three elements, I pulled <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/">five images from my portfolio</a> and broke down why they do ‚Äî or don‚Äôt ‚Äî deliver on these three elements. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn8Sg1cZAGs">Check out the vlog for the full critique</a>, but here‚Äôs a quick peek at how I broke down these images.</p>

Growing up, anything less than an A was unacceptable to me. In college, a 4.0 was mandatory. Those expectations paid off, but didn‚Äôt work so well after academia.</p>
<p>When I started <a href="https://jonathanleemartin.com/">full-time software development</a>, that perfectionist tendency carried over. Every line of code was meticulously combed for bugs, or removed altogether during the sixth refactor. Caring about code quality is important, but at some point perfection becomes the enemy of useful: 20 near-perfect lines of code have no utility for our users until they‚Äôre shipped.</p>
<p>How do we balance craftsmanship with usefulness? In software development, the cure is to ‚Äúiterate to perfection‚Äù: get your code to 80% quality, have a colleague review the code to get it to 90%, then ship it. Over time, make that code better so it approaches perfection in the long term while still providing utility to your users.</p>
<p><strong>This year has been crazy for photography:</strong> I started writing for two online <a href="https://fstoppers.com/profile/133626/articles">photography</a> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/author/jonathan-martin/">publications</a>, vlogging on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzW75NP8kpRAC-fXKvpl-Q">YouTube</a> and blogging here. As I funnel more time and energy into landscape photography, I‚Äôm rediscovering my perfectionist tendencies. After all, photography (and writing) is an art ‚Äî what artist wants to show or publish less than perfect artwork?</p>
<p>In spending 20‚Äì30 hours a week on photography-related work, I find myself improving at shipping things that are 80% ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù out of sheer need.</p>
<p>So when I get not-infrequent comments to the effect of ‚Äúthe production quality is awful‚Äù or ‚ÄúI just wasted my time reading this,‚Äù my first instinct is bitterness. But after a few minutes, it quickly turns into self-reproach: why isn‚Äôt my work ‚Äî vlogs, articles or photos ‚Äî perfect like the old days?</p>
<p><strong>Should I dig out my old perfectionist tendencies so I can safely return to being my only critic?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúBetter to do something imperfectly than to do nothing flawlessly.‚Äù<br>
‚Äî Robert H. Schuller</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My 60% ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù a month from now will be today‚Äôs 80%. In the long term, imperfect work will become more perfect <em>while providing utility to people now.</em> The challenge is to convince myself that providing utility now is worth the unkind words.</p>
<p>I think of the small businesses and private ventures my friends operate, and realize I‚Äôm guilty: not of making discouraging comments about their efforts, <strong>but omitting to exhort them.</strong> It‚Äôs not enough to not be a jerk ‚Äî it‚Äôs my <em>privilege</em> and responsibility to encourage my peers who are <em>doing</em> things in spite of disparaging comments.</p>
<p>I have a challenge for you: this next week, <strong>pick one person or business who is doing something, and exhort them.</strong> Be their cheerleader. It‚Äôs as simple as leaving a thoughtful comment on their social media post or sending a text message. You will make their day. You may not use their product or think it‚Äôs tacky, but that‚Äôs not the point: encouraging our colleagues is the <em>least</em> we can do to invest in someone‚Äôs well-being.</p>
<p>The product ‚Äî tacky, low production quality or otherwise ‚Äî will improve with time. So invest a little of your time to feed them with the encouragement they need to stay strong.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a free, easy way to practice empathy ‚Äî and that‚Äôs a life skill we could all stand to perfect.</p>

<p>To become a successful photographer, you just need to keep up what you‚Äôre doing, right? Many photographers would give a ‚Äúyes, but‚Äù answer and rightly exhort you to reach further. The common recommendations for advancing in your craft might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shoot more often</li>
<li>Try shooting a new genre</li>
<li>Imitate another photographer‚Äôs style</li>
<li>Imitate the path of successful photographers</li>
</ul>
<p>All good advice ‚Äî except for one: ‚ÄúImitate the path of successful photographers.‚Äù</p>
<p>Wait, should we imitate <em>unsuccessful photographers</em>? Not exactly, that‚Äôs not the logical antithesis. Rather, you should concentrate on learning from <em>unsuccessful photographs</em> ‚Äî <strong>especially those in your own portfolio.</strong></p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mi31TT6DJsU" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>To motivate this, ask yourself the question: what is your objective as a photographer? Why do you spend more time in photography whenever you can?</p>
<ol>
<li>To become the best in your craft?</li>
<li>To fund your photographic endeavors?</li>
<li>To make a full-time living from photography?</li>
<li>To develop a reputation?</li>
</ol>
<p>If your current priority is to become the best in your craft, imitating successful photographers is actually the irrational way to maximize your learning. You <em>will</em> grow and you <em>can</em> be successful in your field this way, but if you want to maximize your time investment, it‚Äôs worth cultivating smarter habits that accelerate your learning.</p>
<p>Trying to learn from successes while neglecting failures is a <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/advance-your-travel-photography-by-spotting-these-cognitive-biases/">cognitive bias</a> called Survivorship Bias. It‚Äôs a selection bias: the only data-points we see are those which made it past a certain filter that imparts a bias on the data. <a href="https://medium.com/@penguinpress/an-excerpt-from-how-not-to-be-wrong-by-jordan-ellenberg-664e708cfc3d">Abraham Wald played a critical role during World War II</a> when he identified Survivorship Bias in strategies for armoring bombers.</p>
<p>Survivorship Bias is the equivalent of being handed a set of even numbers and making the observation ‚Äúoh, all these numbers are even!‚Äù You‚Äôd be absolutely right, but you‚Äôve learned no new information because the even numbers were already <em>selected.</em> What you stated was true, but yielded no new information ‚Äî like how to <em>generate</em> an even number from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>You learned nothing.</strong></p>
<p>Success stories are an example of selection bias. We only see successes ‚Äî people, photos, products ‚Äî that made it past the selection process, and that selection process imparts a non-trivial selection bias on the data-points due to marketing, timing or difficult to replicate effects.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs the same in landscape photography: when you spend your time looking at photos you consider successful, you aren‚Äôt learning much new information. After all, these photos already meet your criteria of a successful photo, but given a photo that doesn‚Äôt quite meet those criteria, you won‚Äôt know how to get there beyond starting from scratch with another photo.</p>
<p>So although you <em>can</em> grow from analyzing successful photographs, it‚Äôs far from the  <em>best</em> way to spend your learning efforts. You already have a phenomenal data source to facilitate smarter growth: all your photos you <em>didn‚Äôt</em> like from a shoot!</p>
<p><strong>Here‚Äôs how you can turn those rejected shots into actionable insights to accelerate your growth.</strong></p>
<h2 id="1takenotesinthefield">1. Take notes in the field</h2>
<p>While you scope out locations and dial in camera settings, record your brainwaves. Are you hesitating to pull out the tripod because it‚Äôs a pain to put back? What does it feel like to get out for an early dawn shoot? These are important vital signs to track: they will produce accurate, actionable course corrections sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>On my last trip to Oregon, I kept missing twilight because I was anxious about hiking back in the dark. I‚Äôve done this on so many trips without remembering to fix the issue, but this time I finally took notes to that effect. The next day, <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/ultralight-digital-nomad-packing-list/">I purchased a headlamp</a> and was able to hike fearlessly into twilight. Yes, I was stupid not to have done that before ‚Äî but I suppose being stupid is human nature.</p>
<h2 id="2journalabouttheexperience">2. Journal about the experience</h2>
<p>One or two times a day, journal about the day‚Äôs experience. Voice recording is a great way to get these out quickly and capture raw thoughts that congeal into a story. I love recapping everything that happened during the day ‚Äî random things that made me smile, frustrations and adventures. It may feel like a rehash of taking notes in the field, but I find I tend to see recurring patterns better when I take notes throughout the day and only journal once a day.</p>
<h2 id="3editphotosimmediately">3. Edit photos immediately</h2>
<p>Every day is precious, so the fastest way to improve is to close the feedback loop. I usually edit the prior shoot‚Äôs photos at noon and in the evening an hour after the sunrise or sunset shoot. Although the edit I produce is rarely exceptional, I‚Äôll quickly spot issues that I wouldn‚Äôt otherwise notice in-camera. But don‚Äôt spend too long editing the photos you like!</p>
<h2 id="4critiquerejectedphotos">4. Critique rejected photos</h2>
<p>The key to defeating survivorship bias is to spend most of your time analyzing the photos you <em>don‚Äôt</em> like.  You may be tempted to spend your time editing killer shots to perfection, but what about all the other photos you took that didn‚Äôt make the cut? Why don‚Äôt they work, and what would it take to make them work next time? You don‚Äôt want to make the same mistakes again!</p>
<p>So rather than spend all your time focusing on the photos that look great ‚Äî and are probably just like your existing portfolio ‚Äî scan only through those that didn‚Äôt quite work out.</p>
<h2 id="5holdaretrospective">5. Hold a retrospective</h2>
<p>What caused these failed shots? Did you overlook the composition? Overexpose a shot? Did you spend too long at one spot, only to find it was a bad angle? It‚Äôs not enough to pick out <em>why</em> a photo doesn‚Äôt work: you need to hypothesize <em>what</em> caused the failure!</p>
<h2 id="6writedownanactionlist">6. Write down an action list</h2>
<p>What are you going to change to squelch these issues? Write down what you are going to do differently for this evening or tomorrow‚Äôs shoot so you can close the feedback loop.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe faintest ink is more powerful than the strongest memory.‚Äù Don‚Äôt cheat yourself into thinking you‚Äôll remember to address these issues in the field, <strong>write them down.</strong> When you arrive for the shoot, explain to yourself how you are addressing each issue right now.</p>
<h2 id="beatingsurvivorshipbias">Beating survivorship bias</h2>
<p>These steps may seem like busywork, but that‚Äôs exactly why we tend to waste so much time in the learning process: we neglect the simple steps that empower us to learn with intentionality. Why take a week to learn passively from your mistakes, instead of taking one day to overcome them?</p>
<p>So take control of your learning! Learning with intentionality is one of the most rewarding ways you can get more for less as a photographer.</p>

But like many crafts, you rarely have time to invest in your personal assets like you do into client work; when that time does come, it‚Äôs rarely a strategic goal. ‚ÄúA contractor‚Äôs house is never finished.‚Äù</p>
<p>So I had a fun weekend ‚Äî it finally became a strategic goal to hand-code <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com">Yellowscale.com</a> from scratch. In case web geekery intrigues you:</p>
<ul>
<li>It uses some ‚Äúnew‚Äù CSS toys: CSS Grid, Variables, position:sticky and Flexbox. Well, I guess Flexbox isn‚Äôt really new, but you‚Äôd be surprised how many agencies still use float hacks. üò±</li>
<li>It‚Äôs wicked fast thanks to all the usual <a href="https://www.nybblr.com/metrics-metrics-how-we-improved-website-performance-part-2/">web performance tricks</a>, plus some newer ones like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content">preload</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/resource-prioritization">preconnect</a>!  üèé</li>
<li>It passed some accessibility audits ‚Äî yay ARIA and Lighthouse! üí°</li>
</ul>
<p>Previously, I heavily monkey-patched a <a href="https://html5up.net/">template from HTML5 UP</a>. It served me well, but it feels so nice to code from scratch!</p>
<p>And there are a few new photos too! Have a peek. üëá<br>

But if you want to see a country more like a local ‚Äî away from tourists ‚Äî you won‚Äôt get to those locations quickly with public transit. After all, if tourists can reach it easily by public transit, they‚Äôll already be there!</p>
<p>So if you want to <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/fstoppers-discover-unique-landscape-photography-spots-before-takeoff/">explore more unique locations</a>, a car rental needs to be on your expense list. As a landscape photographer, this is non-negotiable since I want to find landscapes that most people won‚Äôt go to.</p>
<p>I knew nothing about car insurance for <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/19-tips-for-international-travelers-adventurers-edition/">my first trip five years ago</a>, so it was incredibly confusing to understand all the terms and coverages and scenarios. Since then, I‚Äôve become well acquainted with international car rentals, especially in Europe.</p>
<p>Hopefully I can spare you some of that confusion. Here‚Äôs everything you need to know about international car rentals.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5K68O1ZSjMc" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<h2 id="bookingthevehicle">Booking the Vehicle</h2>
<p>When you make your reservation, make sure you book with free cancellation and don‚Äôt have to enter your credit card number. More details in my post on <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/5-tips-to-save-money-on-international-travel/">five money-saving travel tips</a>, but here‚Äôs the TL;DR: <strong>don‚Äôt book directly with the rental agency</strong> since they usually ask for a credit card number. You‚Äôll be hard pressed to find a better rate through couponing than just checking rates periodically through Expedia or Priceline. With free cancellation, you‚Äôre locking in a rate that‚Äôs easy to rebook without penalties.</p>
<p>Be wary of purchasing extras like insurance or an extra driver ahead of time. In particular, I don‚Äôt recommend purchasing car insurance through your booking site. I purchased insurance through Expedia for my first trip to Scotland, but the rental company would not honor it and made me purchase their insurance. It was not pleasant to find out at the counter that our car rental price would be double what we booked.</p>
<h2 id="handlingcarinsurance">Handling Car Insurance</h2>
<p>Your personal policy probably doesn‚Äôt cover driving overseas, so you‚Äôll need to make alternate insurance arrangements for your trip. In most countries, the rental already include zero-deductible liability: that means if you get in an accident and it‚Äôs your fault, liability will fix the other person‚Äôs car.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs <em>your</em> car that you have to worry about. In some countries, you could be out the entire price of the vehicle, but in most of the countries I‚Äôve traveled to, it‚Äôs capped at a high deductible like 5000 EUR. The agency will offer various collision damage waiver tiers to get that deductible down for a (pricey) daily fee.</p>
<p>This is the trickiest part of a car rental, and it goes by many names like Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) or Loss Damage Waiver (LDW). The agency might offer additional insurance that just covers glass, windshield or tire damage. If you can at all help it, <strong>don‚Äôt purchase the car rental agency‚Äôs insurance.</strong></p>
<h2 id="creditcardcdwbenefits">Credit Card CDW Benefits</h2>
<p>Here‚Äôs where a solid credit card comes in. Several of the major credit card companies offer <strong>zero-deductible CDW for free.</strong> While this benefit is normally secondary to your personal insurance, overseas it becomes primary: if you‚Äôre at fault for an accident, you‚Äôll have no deductible to pay and the premiums on your personal insurance won‚Äôt go up!</p>
<p>That‚Äôs incredible when you would otherwise pay an extra $10‚Äì$50 per day for the rental agency‚Äôs insurance ‚Äî which <em>still</em> has a deductible. And when you do get in an accident, <strong>you‚Äôll be working with your credit card company</strong> rather than making international calls to the agency‚Äôs insurance. It‚Äôs hard to overstate how much of a win that is, especially when rental agency customer support tends to be unexceptional.</p>
<p>The difficulty is getting the rental agent to cooperate. I‚Äôve been caught off guard twice in the UK, and the first time I paid double the rate to cover insurance I didn‚Äôt actually need because I didn‚Äôt have proof of CDW.</p>
<p>Call your credit card company well before your trip to discuss all the terms of their CDW benefit and make sure they cover collision in all countries you‚Äôll be visiting. In particular, only a few credit cards cover collision in Ireland ‚Äî including mine, which was better than the ‚ÄúSuper CDW‚Äù you would typically purchase in Ireland.</p>
<h2 id="pickinguptherental">Picking up the Rental</h2>
<p>Sadly, the most frustrating hurdle comes after the red-eye flight: picking up the rental. The agents are often fast-talking salespeople who will be hard to refute without all your mental faculties, so <strong>shortcut the conversation by declining all extras and insurance.</strong></p>
<p>Extras go by many names, so if the price deviates slightly from your booked rate, show the agent your confirmation email and ask why it‚Äôs different. If they offer to upgrade you to a fancy vehicle, remember that more expensive vehicles are more expensive to insure ‚Äî which will slam you if you‚Äôre in an accident.</p>
<p>To decline the agency‚Äôs insurance, you will need to show proof of your collision damage waiver benefit through your credit card company. For some agencies, this proof must be dated within the last 30 days, so call your credit card company ahead of time to make sure they‚Äôll cover your needs, then ask them to email you proof of CDW a few weeks out from your trip.</p>
<p>If you accept any of the rental company‚Äôs insurance, your credit card‚Äôs collision benefit will not apply at all for that rental. So if you want to take advantage of your card‚Äôs CDW, <strong>you must decline the rental agency‚Äôs insurance.</strong></p>
<h2 id="declininginsuranceintheuk">Declining Insurance in the UK</h2>
<p>There‚Äôs one confusing exception: in the UK, all rentals are required to include minimum collision insurance. This caught me off guard last year, but unlike my first trip to the UK I had cell service. I called my credit card company, and they explained that so long as I accepted only the minimum insurance and declined any lower deductible options, they would honor any CDW claims.</p>
<p>When you decline, the rental agency will often charge you an ‚Äúadmin fee‚Äù that varies from $10‚Äì$50. Some of the sketchier agencies will refuse to let you decline their insurance at all, so call ahead and ask what their administrative fee is for waiving collision.</p>
<h2 id="extradriver">Extra Driver</h2>
<p>While you‚Äôre on the phone, ask the agency about their rates for an extra driver. Many countries will let a spouse drive for free, but you‚Äôll have to pay extra for a family member or friend. The daily rate for an extra driver could be high enough to sway you to a different rental company altogether.</p>
<p><strong>Never pretend you‚Äôll be the only driver and let your travel companion(s) drive.</strong> If they get in an accident, your credit card‚Äôs collision benefit won‚Äôt apply. For your credit card‚Äôs collision to cover those drivers, their names must appear on the rental agreement.</p>
<h2 id="whereareyouheaded">Where Are You Headed?</h2>
<p>Nothing compares to seeing a country from the driver‚Äôs seat, and with a few phone calls you can ensure it‚Äôs a cheap option too.</p>
<p>I hope this helps you navigate the confusing domain of car rentals and gives you the courage to take advantage of all that your travel destination has to offer.

With one carry-on sized backpack. It sounds crazy, but every digital nomad packing list I see tends to converge to this utopia, and it‚Äôs not surprising why.</p>
<p><strong>No checked bags means:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>No wait to check bags or surprise fees</li>
<li>No lost baggage</li>
<li>You can use budget airlines</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Traveling with one carry-on bag means:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Much less stress during transit and fewer missed layovers</li>
<li>No repacking between hotels and fewer misplaced items</li>
<li>Less stress if your rental car gets smashed</li>
</ol>
<p>In a word, traveling light with one carry-on sized bag is <em>freedom</em>.</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/the-digital-nomad-lifestyle-is-more-about-freedom-and-less-about-travel/">digital nomad</a>, honing your one bag packing list will help turn your dream of traveling around the world indefinitely into reality, and <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/your-map-to-mount-nomad/">now is the time for you to practice</a>.</p>
<p>I didn‚Äôt instantly cut down my existence to one bag: <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/stuff-that-hasnt-ruined-my-life/">I‚Äôve spent years</a> learning what I can and can‚Äôt get away with. To expedite your journey, <strong>here‚Äôs my entire minimalist packing list.</strong> It‚Äôs long, so here‚Äôs a table if you want to skip around.</p>

<h2 id="bags">Bags</h2>
<p>Lies. Actually, I‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ have‚Ä¶ recommendations yet! I‚Äôve traveled for a year with a Lowepro hiking bag ‚Äî it works, but I‚Äôve not been overly happy with it. So until I find the perfect bag, I‚Äôll hold off on a recommendation.</p>
<p>However, if you aren‚Äôt traveling with camera gear, <strong>go with a daypack</strong> instead of a full-blown backpack. I love my 17 liter North Face daypack (discontinued,¬†<a href="https://www.amazon.com/North-Face-Jester-Backpack-Black/dp/B00OS67V6S/?tag=nybblr08-20">here‚Äôs a larger one</a> if you‚Äôre less lucky at T.J.Maxx), but there‚Äôs not anything particularly special about it other than the size. Thanks to a strict packing regime, it holds everything I need for indefinite travel‚Ä¶ without camera gear.</p>
<p>Also, don‚Äôt forget to pack a <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Outdoor-Products-Packable-Daypack-Black/19487073">foldable nylon daypack</a>. <em>Bag inception.</em> It takes almost no space, and after your flight you can shove clothes and toiletries in it so your main bag sheds some weight.</p>
<h2 id="clothes">Clothes</h2>
<p>I‚Äôve spent a few years honing my ultralight wardrobe, and a few characteristics apply to everything. First, <strong>eliminate any clothing that is 100% cotton.</strong> This is a non-negotiable: you won‚Äôt exactly wash your clothes everyday, and cotton will be unpleasant during use, smell awful after use, and turn to rock once you get around to washing it. Why pack 10 cotton tees that fit so-so and are miserable in hot weather, instead of owning 3 shirts that look great and are made of materials that perform well in inclement weather?</p>
<p>Your wardrobe should be primarily made of nature‚Äôs miracle fabric, <strong>merino wool.</strong> It resists odors, keeps you cool in the heat and warm in the cold, and air dries without turning to rock. Even when I‚Äôm not traveling, merino wool is pretty much the only fabric I own. Yes, it‚Äôs pricey ‚Äî but you only need 2‚Äì3 of most items, and you won‚Äôt purchase them often. It‚Äôs a small price to pay for legendary comfort and not smelling like a vagabond.</p>
<p><strong>I follow the three-layer system:</strong> a merino wool base layer, a down jacket for the mid layer and a rain jacket for the outer layer. Whether I‚Äôm headed for 80 degrees or 20 degrees, I‚Äôm covered!</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs the entire clothing list:</p>
<h3 id="shirts">Shirts</h3>
<p><strong>3 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Icebreaker-Everyday-Short-Sleeve-Crewe/dp/B00AF6ZV4O/?tag=nybblr08-20">Icebreaker merino wool shirts</a></strong> for the base layer: a short sleeve and long sleeve will cover a wide range of temperatures. Merino wool comes in <a href="https://www.onebagger.com/merino-wool-guide/">a lot of grades</a> and weights, so it‚Äôs not a place to skimp. Short sleeves are generally thin and come in a weight of 150 g/m2 (grams per square meter), while long sleeves are a thicker 200 g/m2. I travel with 3 variations:</p>
<ol>
<li>A dressy black <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Icebreaker-Merino-Anatomica-Sleeve-Monsoon/dp/B01GXGN6HI/?tag=nybblr08-20">Icebreaker Anatomica V-neck</a>, with a fabric weight of 150 g/m2. It‚Äôs well fitted, so it looks great solo or layered under anything. Lately these are getting hard to find at less than retail price, so you might have to do some googling if you can‚Äôt find a color and size you like. If V-necks aren‚Äôt your thing, I own a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072KVDXMW/?tag=nybblr08-20">crew version as well</a> that served me well.</li>
<li>A thicker <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AF5ISPO/?tag=nybblr08-20">Icebreaker Oasis Crewe</a>, which comes in 200 g/m2. It seems discontinued, but there‚Äôs a newer lookalike with the same specs, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Icebreaker-Everyday-Short-Sleeve-Crewe/dp/B00AF6ZV4O/?tag=nybblr08-20">Icebreaker Everyday Crewe</a>. The crew is slightly less fitted than the Anatomica lineup, but look greats and has seen the most use ‚Äî even in warmer climates.</li>
<li>A long sleeve <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Icebreaker-Merino-Everyday-Sleeve-Crewe/dp/B00AF6ZKL8/?tag=nybblr08-20">Icebreaker Everyday Long Sleeve Tee</a> in 200 g/m2. I use it in two extremes: when it‚Äôs below 30 degrees outside, or when it‚Äôs hot and sunny. It sounds counterintuitive, but the long sleeves keep the heat off you while wicking away sweat, so it‚Äôs often more comfortable than a short sleeve and wearing sunscreen.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="downjacket">Down Jacket</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Patagonia-Mens-Down-Sweater-Hoodie/dp/B073RP8KSK/?tag=nybblr08-20">Patagonia down jacket</a></strong>. You can‚Äôt beat a down jacket for weight to warmth ratio, but like merino wool, a down jacket isn‚Äôt just for the frozen fjords: it acts as an insulator in moderate temperatures. I frequently wear a merino base layer and down jacket in 50 degree weather and don‚Äôt notice the warmth.</p>
<p>Down jackets don‚Äôt have to break the bank: before upgrading to my Patagonia down jacket, I used a $50 REI Coop jacket that still does a great job. In fact, it fits more easily in my camera bag.</p>
<h3 id="rainjacket">Rain Jacket</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Outdoor-Research-Helium-Jacket-Black/dp/B00ELMXNG6/?tag=nybblr08-20">Outdoor Research Helium HD rain jacket</a></strong>. The outer layer doesn‚Äôt see constant use like the base and mid layers, but it‚Äôs indispensable for any traveler. A DWR-treated down jacket is not enough: the third layer is meant to provide <em>real</em> wind and water protection. You should always have a rain jacket handy, so I opted for the best ultralight option I could find. Fair disclosure: because I use rain jackets infrequently, I haven‚Äôt put my HD under too much stress, but so far it‚Äôs been a huge upgrade from my clammy North Face Venture jacket.</p>
<p>If you are willing to forego a few features, go for ‚Äúthe‚Äù ultralight champion: the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Outdoor-Research-Helium-Jacket-Pewter/dp/B005BV8834/?tag=nybblr08-20">Outdoor Research Helium II rain jacket</a>. This is the #1 recommendation in ultralight jackets, and it‚Äôs cheaper than the HD! I went with the HD for one reason: I need pockets. Otherwise, the Helium II would have been my clear choice.</p>
<h3 id="socks">Socks</h3>
<p><strong>2‚Äì3 pairs of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Darn-Tough-Vermont-Cushion-X-Large/dp/B008RSF3OU/?tag=nybblr08-20">Darn Tough merino wool socks</a></strong>. There‚Äôs nothing worse than rotten smelling socks after a day of hiking. These socks are worth every dollar ‚Äî they keep the feet comfortable in all climates, have lots of cushion, resist odor, and are pretty easy to hand-wash. I‚Äôve worn the same 2 pairs every day for 3 years.</p>
<p>I have 2 pairs of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Darn-Tough-Vermont-Cushion-X-Large/dp/B008RSF3OU/?tag=nybblr08-20">Darn Tough‚Äôs 1/4 style</a>, which are my favorite to wear, and for shorts weather I have 2 pairs of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Darn-Tough-No-Show-Cushion-Athletic/dp/B00F0NCJNS/?tag=nybblr08-20">Darn Tough No Shows</a>. Supposedly Darn Tough will replace the sock if it gets a hole, but I haven‚Äôt yet needed to take advantage of that.</p>
<h3 id="leggings">Leggings</h3>
<p><strong>1 pair of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AFOPNBC/?tag=nybblr08-20">Icebreaker Oasis merino wool leggings</a></strong> to go under your jeans in sub 30 degree weather. With some luck, sometimes you can snag a pair out of season for $20 at a T.J.Maxx.</p>
<h3 id="jeans">Jeans</h3>
<p><strong>1 pair of jeans with &gt; 20% polyester</strong>. Jeans are the bane of my existence, and most pairs I buy end up with the dreaded hole-in-crotch. My favorite pair of jeans finally ripped a week ago, but it‚Äôs the <em>only</em> pair I‚Äôve worn for 3 years. The secret? <strong>Polyester.</strong> Polyester mix jeans are incredibly durable, insanely light, comfortable and surprisingly stylish even on business trips. They hold their shape well and dry out quickly.</p>
<p>If you have some time, keep an eye on your local department stores and you may find a pair of $20 with patience. Whatever you do, don‚Äôt travel with cotton jeans ‚Äî your everything thanks you.</p>
<p>Now that my faithful pair has finally ripped, I‚Äôm considering investing in some ‚Äútrue‚Äù travel pants, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/prAna-30-Inch-Inseam-Charcoal-inseam/dp/B006QM6XM0/?tag=nybblr08-20">prAna Brion pants</a> are at the top of my list. These are the final word in ultralight durability thanks to the mostly nylon construction, and they‚Äôre DWR-treated. The best part? They‚Äôre really affordable compared to the typical rate for specialty hiking jeans. I‚Äôm just waiting to find them locally to check the fit and look.</p>
<h3 id="underwear">Underwear</h3>
<p><strong>3 pairs of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ExOfficio-Give-N-Go-Boxer-Brief-Medium/dp/B001M0MMZS/?tag=nybblr08-20">ExOfficio Boxer Briefs</a></strong>. Yep, time for fancy underwear. Anything that isn‚Äôt 100% cotton will do, but polyester is the way to go since you have to sink wash them every (other?) day anyway. My pairs pilled a bit when I first got them, but haven‚Äôt gotten any worse after 2 years of constant use.</p>
<p>A word of warning: lately ExOfficio seems to be having quality assurance issues. My brother just got the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ExOfficio-Give-N-Go-Sport-Medium-Phantom/dp/B00MOBSSUC/?tag=nybblr08-20">ExOfficio Sport Boxer Briefs</a> and it started sticking to itself and pilling like crazy after one sink-wash ‚Äî disappointing to say the least. The original ExOfficio Boxer Briefs aren‚Äôt as comfortable for hiking, so the Sport was on my upgrade list, but I think I‚Äôll wait till quality control gets their act together.</p>
<h3 id="shoes">Shoes</h3>
<p><strong>1 pair of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Merrell-Mens-Gore-Tex-Hiking-Chocolate/dp/B001FYVMCA/?tag=nybblr08-20">waterproof Merrell Gore-Tex hiking shoes</a></strong>. I‚Äôm not sold on the look, but hiking shoes are definitely my go-to travel shoes for city trekking and hiking in the Lake District fells.</p>
<h2 id="tech">Tech</h2>
<h3 id="smartphone">Smartphone</h3>
<p><strong>Any smartphone</strong> except an iPhone Plus or Samsung Galaxy. A giant phone screen will be your enemy as a nomad: many of the travel jeans don‚Äôt have a large enough pocket, and given the amount of walking and hiking you‚Äôll be doing, a large screen will either get bent or smashed.</p>
<h3 id="laptop">Laptop</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MNYF2LL-MacBook-Processor-Version/dp/B072QGG3V7/?tag=nybblr08-20">12‚Äù MacBook</a></strong> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Retina-MPXV2LL-Version/dp/B071WLXKB3/?tag=nybblr08-20">13‚Äù MacBook Pro</a>. Lugging around a 15‚Äù brick is out of the question. I‚Äôve switched between the 13‚Äù and 12‚Äù over the last few years, and I‚Äôm torn: the 12‚Äù is the last word on portability and plenty powerful for everything <em>except</em> editing photos. If I can find a backpack I like and cut down the weight of my camera gear, I‚Äôll probably go back to the 13-incher. C‚Äômon Apple, work your magic!</p>
<h3 id="headlamp">Headlamp</h3>
<p><strong>Hiking headlamp like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-Diamond-Spot-Headlamp-Size/dp/B06W54SBSL/?tag=nybblr08-20">Black Diamond Spot</a></strong>. I prefer a USB rechargeable one so I don‚Äôt need to carry backup batteries (more weight and space), but haven‚Äôt yet tested out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-Diamond-Revolt-Headlamp-Denim/dp/B01LE9Z6PO/?tag=nybblr08-20">Black Diamond ReVolt</a>.</p>
<h3 id="adapters">Adapters</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Type-C-HDMI-Multiport-Adapter/dp/B01LYJQ5ZD/?tag=nybblr08-20">Amazon Basics USB-C adapter</a></strong>. Yeah, you can pay 50% more for Apple‚Äôs, but from the reviews it seems notoriously glitchy. On the off-chance my Amazon Basics version goes bad, I also tote the teeny tiny <a href="https://www.amazon.com/nonda-Adapter-Aluminum-Indicator-Macbook/dp/B015Z7XE0A/?tag=nybblr08-20">nonda USB-C to USB 3.0</a> adapter.</p>
<h3 id="plugadapters">Plug Adapters</h3>
<p><strong>2 OREI plug adapters</strong> for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DTRHB2G/?tag=nybblr08-20">mainland Europe</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/OREI-Grounded-Universal-Adapter-Singapore/dp/B004SCSV2U/?tag=nybblr08-20">the UK</a>. Keep in mind that these plugs do <strong>not</strong> convert the voltage, so check all your electronics to make sure they can operate on the country‚Äôs power grid. Most smartphones, laptops and camera gear work with 240V out of the box, but always double check lest you fry your gear and hotel room.</p>
<p>As I expand my list of countries I may consider a universal plug adapter, but the dedicated plugs are so cheap, light, compact and expendable that I don‚Äôt see any reason to purchase a bulky universal adapter.</p>
<h3 id="earbuds">Earbuds</h3>
<p><strong>OEM Apple earbuds</strong>. Hard to lose, cheap to replace, but useless on flights. Bulky headphones are out of the question, but I‚Äôm eyeing these noise-blocking earbuds: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00D429Y12/?tag=nybblr08-20">Bose QuietComfort 20i</a>. I‚Äôm not ready to drop a few hundred bucks on earbuds, but if I decide to care about audio and noise cancellation, these will be first on my wishlist.</p>
<h3 id="backupdrive">Backup Drive</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Portable-External-Photography-STDR2000100/dp/B00FRHTTIU/?tag=nybblr08-20">Seagate 2TB Slim External Hard Drive</a></strong>. I back up my photos daily for a total of three copies: originals on my CompactFlash cards, imported DNGs on my laptop, and DNG copies on my the backup drive.</p>
<p>In case my backpack is stolen, I keep backup devices in at least two locations. In transit, I keep CF cards in my pocket and the backup drive in my backpack. Since rear-end collisions are common, I recommend storing your gear in the rear passenger seat instead of the trunk.</p>
<h3 id="carcharger">Car Charger</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-PowerDrive-iPhone-Galaxy/dp/B00VH84L5E/?tag=nybblr08-20">Anker Dual USB car charger</a></strong>. As a digital nomad, it seems impossible to live without a smartphone ‚Äî maps, bookings, offline translations ‚Äî so a dead phone triggers my panic button. <strong>Never cheap out on chargers:</strong> a poor converter will damage your pricey equipment.</p>
<h2 id="photographygear">Photography Gear</h2>
<h3 id="camerabody">Camera Body</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Frame-Full-HD-Digital-Camera/dp/B007FGYZFI/?tag=nybblr08-20">Canon 5D Mark III</a></strong>. Someday I‚Äôll probably switch to a mirrorless like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Full-frame-Mirrorless-Interchangeable-Lens-ILCE7M3K/dp/B07B45D8WV/?tag=nybblr08-20">Sony a7 III</a>, but till then I‚Äôll be shooting on my faithful 5D.</p>
<h3 id="cameralens">Camera Lens</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-EF-16-35mm-USM-Lens/dp/B00K8942SO/?tag=nybblr08-20">Canon 16‚Äì35mm f/4 L lens</a></strong> with hood. I used the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-24-105mm-USM-Zoom-Lens/dp/B000B84KAW/?tag=nybblr08-20">24‚Äì105mm</a> for the last 5 years, but it will stay at home now since <a href="https://fstoppers.com/originals/how-fit-your-gear-and-clothes-one-bag-travel-indefinitely-226731">I only travel with one lens</a>.</p>
<h3 id="memorycards">Memory Cards</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-Professional-1066x-CompactFlash-LCF32GCRBNA10662/dp/B00IQCRTQ2/?tag=nybblr08-20">Lexar 1066x CompactFlash cards</a></strong>. Your memory cards need to be rock-solid reliable after thousands of miles traveled and dollars spent. And with <a href="https://www.magiclantern.fm/">Magic Lantern</a>, these cards are fast enough to <a href="https://vimeo.com/139290481">shoot gorgeous RAW footage</a>. Still, I‚Äôm looking forward to a mirrorless camera so I can just use cheaper SD cards.</p>
<h3 id="cardreader">Card Reader</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-Professional-USB-Dual-Slot-Reader/dp/B00WBK03OU/?tag=nybblr08-20">Lexar CompactFlash card reader</a></strong>. Cheap readers can corrupt CF cards, so it‚Äôs worth spending a few extra dollars for a reputable one.</p>
<h3 id="camerabattery">Camera Battery</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-9486B002-Battery-Pack-LP-E6N/dp/B00NI3CSIS/?tag=nybblr08-20">1 extra battery</a></strong>. The 5D‚Äôs impressive battery life usually lasts a couple days, but more than once I‚Äôve forgotten to charge it.</p>
<h3 id="cplfilter">CPL Filter</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kaesemann-Circular-Polarizer-Multi-Resistant-Coating/dp/B00OK6YSAS/?tag=nybblr08-20">B+W CPL filter</a></strong>. I have the previous generation, but B+W recently released an upgraded polarizer that cuts out less light and is cheaper.</p>
<h3 id="ndfilter">ND Filter</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/1-8-64x-Multi-Resistant-Coating-Camera-66-1089230/dp/B01MRU56X0/?tag=nybblr08-20">B+W 6-stop ND filter</a></strong>. I own a 10-stop filter as well, but since it‚Äôs rarely called for I have stopped packing it altogether.</p>
<h3 id="tripod">Tripod</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sirui-T2205X-Tripod-Section-Height/dp/B004WY7W42/?tag=nybblr08-20">Sirui T-2205X Carbon Fiber Tripod</a></strong>. Easily fits in my carry-on backpack. I‚Äôve been through three tripods, and this one strikes the perfect balance between stability and ultralight portability. And the twist locks are fantastic!</p>
<h3 id="ballhead">Ball Head</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sirui-K-20X-Ball-Head-Black/dp/B004QC3COO/?tag=nybblr08-20">Sirui¬†K-20x Ball Head</a></strong>. Arca-style, rock solid, medium weight ball head that won‚Äôt break your camera or the bank.</p>
<h3 id="camerastraps">Camera Straps</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.peakdesign.com/product/straps/leash?acc=953">Peak Design Leash camera straps</a></strong> (in testing). After hating on some cheap shoulder straps, I briefly returned to Canon‚Äôs neck strap, but nowadays I‚Äôm testing out Peak Design‚Äôs straps. The ultralight Leash straps seem to the strike the perfect balance for nomad friendliness. Keep an eye open for updates and reviews!</p>
<h3 id="microfibercloths">Microfiber Cloths</h3>
<p><strong>Two microfiber cloths</strong>. Just steal them from an Apple fanboy.</p>
<h3 id="gloves">Gloves</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://us.photographygloves.com/products/vallerret-photography-glove-markhof-pro-model">Vallerret fingerless merino wool gloves</a></strong>. Fingers are the first thing to freeze in landscape photography, so I consider these part of my photography kit.</p>
<h2 id="toiletries">Toiletries</h2>
<p>The trick to ultralight packing isn‚Äôt to make everything smaller, but to figure out what you don‚Äôt need to bring in the first place! So nowadays <strong>I travel with almost no toiletries</strong> ‚Äî I only carry what I couldn‚Äôt live without. Maybe it sounds anti-climatic, but disposable goods are the easiest to pick up and the most irritating to transport.</p>
<p>No special brands here, it‚Äôs all disposable anyway. At all costs, avoid lots of little plastic bottles ‚Äî if it can go in a plastic bag, do it:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 regular toothbrush. Nope, it‚Äôs not even the cute fold-up one from Walmart‚Äôs travel section.</li>
<li>1 regular (full size) deodorant. The little ones never last long enough and don‚Äôt come in any scent I can stand. Why do deodorant sticks have to be so stupidly bulky?</li>
<li>2 itty bitty toothpaste tubes. Why can‚Äôt they make a toothpaste tube that‚Äôs 3 oz?</li>
<li>TSA-friendly sick kit: some plastic bags with ibuprofen, loratadine and occasionally a <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Rice-Sock">homemade rice bag</a> cover a host of minor ailments.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do have one trick for the guys who want to maintain their hairstyle. Opt for a really thick hair wax or cement instead of gel, and the TSA won‚Äôt count it against your quota of liquids. For the last couple years, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Layrite-Cement-Matte-Hair-Clay/dp/B00UM4ZDCY/?tag=nybblr08-20">Layrite Cement Hair Clay</a> has been my favorite. Not only does it take precious little wax to style, but you can scoop a palmful into a few makeup jars and be set for months at a time.</p>
<h2 id="whewthatseverything">Whew, that‚Äôs everything!</h2>
<p>Hopefully you learned a few tricks for your own ultralight packing list. Obviously this packing list is tailored specifically to my needs as a male digital nomad and landscape photographer.</p>
<p>With all this geekery comes an exhortation: never let unknowns ‚Äî least of all, ideal packing ‚Äî stop you from traveling. Don‚Äôt wait until you have the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù packing setup before seeing the world, because <strong>you will never reach perfection.</strong> However, you will approach perfection much faster through practice and journaling what worked well and what didn‚Äôt.</p>
<p><strong>So pack your bag and go see the world!</strong></p>

For those who love to travel, a couple weeks off is just enough to torture your wanderlust. So if you‚Äôre in a good spot financially, you might consider a more drastic option: <strong>a travel sabbatical.</strong></p>
<p>It‚Äôs much less common in the US, but when treated like an investment, the travel sabbatical is a powerful option to recharge, invest in your career and reevaluate how you want to spend your time and money.</p>
<p>However, when I mention a travel sabbatical to burned-out colleagues, the response is usually a variation of ‚ÄúAre you kidding? I can‚Äôt afford that, and I‚Äôd be quitting my job. All so I can spend time lazing at a beach.‚Äù</p>
<p>I promise my rebuttal isn‚Äôt snarky, because there is truth in what they say: the average American lives beyond their means and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2017/11/18/a-foolish-take-heres-how-much-debt-the-average-us-household-owes/107651700/">carries an average debt of $137k</a>. Payments on new cars, mortgages, credit card debt, student loans ‚Äî in the words of Dave Ramsey, we‚Äôre swimming in debt so we can ‚Äúbuy things we don‚Äôt need with money we don‚Äôt have to impress people we don‚Äôt like.‚Äù</p>
<p>The solution to our debt addiction: <strong>we are work martyrs,</strong> and our life becomes synonymous with our work. No wonder we feel dizzy at the thought of quitting a job!</p>
<h2 id="challengeyourperceptionsaboutwork">Challenge your perceptions about work</h2>
<p>The dynamic duo <a href="https://fstoppers.com/travel/feeling-burned-out-your-day-job-consider-taking-travel-sabbatical-258761">Vagabrothers</a> have some great insights into how you should approach a sabbatical, but the intro especially resonates with me because it highlights the importance of introspection. We‚Äôre heavily influenced by our peers, so we tend to take these assumptions for granted:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must own a car</li>
<li>You must own a house</li>
<li>You need a ‚Äúfulfilling‚Äù career to sustain you till retirement</li>
<li>You should postpone serious travel till retirement</li>
<li>You will quit your job around 65 to retire</li>
</ul>
<p>This is definitely the tried-and-true way to live, but it‚Äôs not the one-true-way to live, nor is it the healthiest. <strong>You have a choice.</strong> It sounds trivial, but we have chained ourselves to how everyone around us lives ‚Äî and we hold the key. You aren‚Äôt less of a person if you choose to take control of your time and finances.</p>
<p>In fact, I commend you. The ‚ÄúAmerican Dream‚Äù isn‚Äôt all that dreamy when you tally up the debts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/01/americans-borrow-record-amounts-for-autos-even-as-interest-rates-rise.html">$31k average debt for car</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thebalance.com/average-monthly-mortgage-payment-4154282">$1k median monthly mortgage payment</a>.</li>
<li>A ‚Äúfulfilling career‚Äù tends to be synonymous with workaholism.</li>
<li>Retirement is becoming an illusion as the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-10/working-past-70-americans-can-t-seem-to-retire">average retirement age goes up</a>.</li>
<li>At retirement, we are less physically able to enjoy travel and less inclined to make lifestyle changes to facilitate it.</li>
<li>The most disturbing debt: postponing travel till the tail-end of our lives robs us of the enrichment it contributes to our lives now.</li>
</ul>
<p>Life doesn‚Äôt have to happen in an office from 9 to 5, 48+ weeks per year from age 20 to 70. But you need to put your time and money into your priorities and ruthlessly evaluate anything that doesn‚Äôt align with them.</p>
<h2 id="evaluateasabbatical">Evaluate a sabbatical</h2>
<p>Assuming you are able to take a sabbatical, it‚Äôs time to ask if you are going for the right reasons and with the right expectations. We‚Äôre subject to a myriad of <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/advance-your-travel-photography-by-spotting-these-cognitive-biases/">cognitive biases that prevent us from reasoning correctly</a>, and the antidote is usually some introspection. So pull out a notebook and ask yourself:</p>
<p><strong>1. Why do you want to take a travel sabbatical?</strong> Like most introspective questions, the answer seems obvious until you articulate it. Do you want to see the world? Spend time recharging? Escape some rough situations at work? Save money ‚Äî yes really, <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/want-to-travel-full-time-your-us-tax-return-might-fund-a-year-off-the-grid/">check out the FEIE</a>. Are there any options besides a sabbatical that would provide similar outcomes?</p>
<p><strong>2. What do you expect to get out of the sabbatical?</strong> You probably don‚Äôt want to just spend 6 months chilling at a beach (or maybe you do). But more likely you feel burned out <em>and</em> have other interests or career paths you want to invest in. You want to ‚Äúchange your life,‚Äù and that won‚Äôt happen with a 9 to 5.</p>
<p>This sabbatical is about personal growth: it‚Äôs not vacation, <strong>it‚Äôs an investment.</strong> So get some rest, but treat the sabbatical like your new full-time job. Be intentional so you can tie expenditures to measurable outcomes ‚Äî there‚Äôs nothing worse than feeling aimless when you pay the hotel bills, and it‚Äôs hard to sell others on your sabbatical if you haven‚Äôt sold yourself on its tangible value.</p>
<p><strong>3. How do you want to spend your time during the sabbatical?</strong> Start building a sample itinerary and a rough breakdown of how you will spend your days. Are you going to shoot during the mornings and do a few hours of freelance writing in the afternoon? You don‚Äôt have to stick with the itinerary, but you should set realistic expectations to reference.</p>
<p><strong>4. What would make the sabbatical a ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù?</strong> Kickstarting a new career? Building up a photography portfolio? Evaluating an overseas move? Recharging your creativity? It‚Äôs a hard question to answer if you are approaching a sabbatical as an extended vacation, but even then, you should spend time qualifying what an effective vacation would do.</p>
<p><strong>5. What are you giving up?</strong> This shouldn‚Äôt come too hard since it‚Äôs the reason so few people consider a sabbatical in the first place. Before you rush to whip up a spreadsheet, list out the tangible <em>and</em> intangible things you are giving up, like job security, a decorated house and game nights with friends. There‚Äôs more at stake than just your paycheck.</p>
<p>Next, pull out a spreadsheet and tally up your current monthly expenses versus income. How would this change during a sabbatical? You‚Äôll forfeit a full-time salary, but there‚Äôs a host of expenses that you can eliminate to compensate for the new ones you‚Äôd take on to travel. Check the numbers from an overseas vacation and use them as a guide.</p>
<p>After some number crunching, you should arrive at two numbers: your current monthly balance of expenditures to salary, and an estimated balance during the sabbatical. The difference between these two is your <strong>opportunity cost.</strong></p>
<p>This is where you put a tangible money value on that travel time. During a 6-month sabbatical, you may be able to average a similar monthly cost to your current costs, but you are also forfeiting pay. The opportunity cost analysis is a more realistic way to account for this loss.</p>
<p><strong>6. What obstacles do you need to start removing now?</strong></p>
<p>The opportunity cost analysis can be sobering, but I find it encouraging because it turns what was previously an unquantified impossibility into an achievable reality. Your next step is to start formulating action steps that will position you for a sabbatical. That might mean:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/stuff-that-hasnt-ruined-my-life/">Selling hordes of clutter</a>.</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/your-map-to-mount-nomad/">Adopting the digital nomad lifestyle</a>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Downsizing expenditures.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tackling your debts.</strong> I highly recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Total-Money-Makeover-Classic-Financial/dp/1595555277/?tag=nybblr08-20">The Total Money Makeover</a> by Dave Ramsey. Few things are as satisfying as the peace and freedom that comes with being debt-free!</li>
</ul>
<p>As a digital nomad, I‚Äôve tried to position myself so that travel, photography and my software career are not in opposition, but fuel each other. It‚Äôs taken several years to get here, and I‚Äôm still a long ways off ‚Äî but the journey alone has enhanced my life and enabled me to pursue opportunities I would never have imagined.</p>
<p>So even if you decide not to take a sabbatical down the road, you‚Äôll be better off for your intentionality.</p>
<h2 id="ignorethepassiveaggressivehints">Ignore the passive aggressive hints</h2>
<p>There will always be peers who will express their disapproval: either they will be forthright, or they will fiddle with your emotional resolve through <a href="https://www.coachingpositiveperformance.com/8-examples-passive-aggressive-behaviour/">passive aggressive hints</a>. They will think you‚Äôre strange, slacking off, lazy, or all the above. But the reality is <em>you are working harder</em> to take control of your career, your time and your money.</p>
<p>Take counsel from those who have demonstrated their commitment to your well-being in the past, but ignore the naysayers who are in debt, buying expensive items they can‚Äôt afford, spending all their time working for companies that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/u-s-workers-vacation-time/index.html">don‚Äôt compensate employees more for loyalty</a>.</p>
<p><strong>You are working towards an investment</strong> ‚Äî not a vacation ‚Äî that is worth more to you than what you leave behind. I for one am cheering you on!</p>

It was also one of the most frustrating trips I‚Äôve taken ‚Äî but I learned so much about landscape photography, particularly about shooting with only an ultra-wide angle lens: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-EF-16-35mm-USM-Lens/dp/B00K8942SO/?tag=nybblr08-20">Canon‚Äôs 16‚Äì35mm f/4 lens</a>.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I made tons of mistakes, but learned more in 15 days than my last few trips combined. Traveling with just an ultra wide-angle lens¬†is a powerful way to improve your landscape photography, especially your compositions.</p>

<p>A couple weeks ago, someone asked me what it meant to be a digital nomad. I rattled off a quick definition: <strong>Digital nomads are people who leverage technology to work from anywhere.</strong> They followed up with: ‚ÄúWhy did <em>you</em> become a digital nomad?‚Äù</p>
<p>I started my usual response: that I loved to travel, that I didn‚Äôt want to be tied down, that stuff isn‚Äôt important to me. But even as I answered, I felt that didn‚Äôt cut it for my current circumstances ‚Äî I haven‚Äôt traveled at all since last year, I have an apartment in Atlanta, and like most apartment tenants I own furniture and a few dishes.</p>
<p>So why am I a digital nomad? What does it mean to be a digital nomad?</p>
<p>When I look at my apartment, <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/ultralight-digital-nomad-packing-list/">I own very little</a>. The only furniture I own is a desk, mattress and IKEA bookshelf. My entire wardrobe fits in a couple IKEA baskets (super great hack by the way, dressers are overrated). It didn‚Äôt happen overnight: <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/your-map-to-mount-nomad/">I‚Äôve been consolidating, selling and giving away for years</a>.</p>
<p>Is owning very little the recipe for being a digital nomad? It certainly seems like a crucial ingredient, but somehow it doesn‚Äôt feel like the hallmark.</p>
<p>I was feeling a bit nostalgic, so I hopped into my journal to do some trip planning. I started outlining how I want to spend a month in Norway, then (finally) see Iceland and do car camping. Perhaps I could see southern New Zealand‚Äôs Alps too.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs when it made sense: the reason I can make outlandish plans and expect to turn them into reality is <em>because</em> I‚Äôm a digital nomad. Owning as little as possible empowers me to drop everything with zero ties or regrets to taint the joys.</p>
<p><strong>Being a digital nomad is about safeguarding your freedom to pursue the lifestyle of your choice with as few impediments as possible, and then pursuing that lifestyle with deliberation and intentionality.</strong></p>
<p>I‚Äôm reading an inspiring article about the experience <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2138841/how-live-out-your-car">living out of a car</a>. I had considered a travel trailer before, but hadn‚Äôt sold myself on the idea of towing my life everywhere I go. Retrofitting an SUV seems like a more reasonable option to start, but the limited space borders on extreme even for me. But my favorite takeaway from the post is this gem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúWhen you don‚Äôt own many things, you don‚Äôt worry about many things.‚Äù<br>
‚ÄîAndy Cochrane</p>
</blockquote>
<p>‚òùÔ∏è That one sentence sums up one of the greatest freedoms of being a digital nomad. You won‚Äôt be on the road 100% of the time (I‚Äôm nowhere near). But no matter where you are, you won‚Äôt have anything stopping you from pursuing your priorities.</p>
<p>So <em>hallo</em> Norway, <em>hall√≥</em> Iceland, and hello New Zealand. There‚Äôs no-thing stopping me.</p>

You‚Äôre not alone. üò© Months or years after a trip, my library is still full of photos with great potential that I can‚Äôt seem to get right. <a href="https://fstoppers.com/education/nine-landscape-photography-techniques-overcome-editors-block-247524">On Fstoppers, we go in-depth on ‚Äúeditor‚Äôs block‚Äù</a> and techniques to get photos out of creative ruts.</p>
<p>Editor‚Äôs block is tough to get past ‚Äî it‚Äôs a form of creative block because post production is one of the most creative parts of the photography workflow. The longer a photo remains in this state, the harder it becomes for us to distance ourselves from the photo to find a new perspective.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GXieXfD3qpQ" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>So how do you get landscape photos out of post-production purgatory? üî• <strong>Most of the techniques focus on reestablishing objectivity:</strong> after all, we‚Äôre phenomenally good at critiquing another photographer‚Äôs work because we can empathize with an audience who has never seen the photo. Objectivity is not exactly an on/off switch, but there are ways to trick our brains into thinking we‚Äôre editing a new photo!</p>
<p>Several of these techniques are borrowed from traditional drawing media, but my favorite is inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing">annealing</a> in metallurgy: <strong>randomly copy-paste settings from other edited photos!</strong> In blacksmithing, annealing refers to heating up a metal and slowly cooling it to produce a stronger result. The heat and controlled cooling allows the metal atoms to move around freely (at random) before slowly settling into the strongest formation.</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Hill_Climbing_with_Simulated_Annealing.gif" alt="9 Landscape Photography Techniques to Overcome Editor‚Äôs Block"></p>
<p>In photography, we are essentially searching for the best looking edit by modifying curves, contrast and many other sliders. With ‚Äúsimulated annealing,‚Äù you start editing by making completely random jumps to discover possible artistic directions, but over time focus on optimizing the better directions. When you‚Äôre stuck, you just need to make random jumps again. It‚Äôs surprisingly effective in blacksmithing‚Ä¶ and post production!</p>
<p>So if you‚Äôre stuck editing the same photo and can't seem to figure out an edit that works, <a href="https://fstoppers.com/education/nine-landscape-photography-techniques-overcome-editors-block-247524">here are nine powerful techniques to get out of editor's block</a>. ‚ú®</p>

<p>You probably think you‚Äôre exceptionally rational. In fact, you might say you‚Äôre more rational than average. Ironically, that perception itself is a cognitive flaw: the bias blind spot.</p>
<p>So why care about cognitive biases if everyone is affected by them? By identifying them in your own reasoning, <strong>you can advance in your craft faster.</strong> This isn‚Äôt fuzzy mumbo jumbo: cognitive biases have a measurable impact on your mood, productivity and decision making, so countering them leads to intentional, measurable progress in your field.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sunk Cost Fallacy,</strong> ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just make the best of it.‚Äù</li>
<li><strong>Planning Fallacy,</strong> ‚ÄúI‚Äôll improve with time.‚Äù</li>
<li><strong>Impostor Syndrome,</strong> ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a total fraud.‚Äù</li>
<li><strong>Observational Selection Bias,</strong> ‚ÄúEveryone has my camera!‚Äù</li>
<li><strong>Anchoring Effect,</strong> ‚ÄúBut the price is reasonable?‚Äù</li>
</ul>
<p>I‚Äôve personally struggled with most of these cognitive biases <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/stuff-is-ruining-your-life/">during the last few years of becoming a digital nomad</a>. At first they mostly related to decluttering, but when I began working remotely full-time, I discovered just how much they affected my work productivity. With some introspection and practice, I boosted my longterm productivity enough that my coworkers and family noticed. Nowadays, <strong>I get 50% more work done in the same amount of time.</strong></p>
<p>‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôll just become a better travel photographer with time and practice.&quot;  True, but you might fall prey to the Planning Fallacy, which leads us to repeat mistakes and disregard prior experience that would otherwise yield actionable insights.</p>
<p>You deserve to get the most out of the time and money you invest in your craft, so check out the entire post on Fstoppers to learn how to <a href="https://fstoppers.com/originals/advance-your-travel-photography-spotting-these-cognitive-biases-240209">spot these biases in your day-to-day thinking and advance your travel photography</a>.</p>
